suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands leon trotsky the main proponent of world revolution was exiled from the soviet union in 1929 and stalin s idea of

major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time under the doctrine of state atheism in the soviet union there was a government sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism conducted by communists the communist regime targeted religions based on state interests and while most organized religions were never outlawed religious property was confiscated believers were harassed and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools in 1925 the government founded the league of militant atheists to intensify the persecution accordingly although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions teachers state bureaucrats soldiers to be openly religious as for the russian orthodox church soviet authorities sought to control it and in times of national crisis to exploit it for the regime s own purposes but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it during the first five years of soviet power the bolsheviks executed 28 russian orthodox bishops and over 1,200 russian orthodox priests many others were imprisoned or exiled believers were harassed and persecuted most seminaries were closed and the publication of most religious material was prohibited by 1941 only 500
