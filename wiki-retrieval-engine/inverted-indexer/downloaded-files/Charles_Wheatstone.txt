1802 19 october 1875 was an english scientist and inventor of many scientific breakthroughs of the victorian era including the english concertina the stereoscope a device for displaying three dimensional images and the playfair cipher an encryption technique however wheatstone is best known for his contributions in the development of the wheatstone bridge originally invented by samuel hunter christie which is used to measure an unknown electrical resistance and as a major figure in the development of telegraphy contents charles wheatstone was born in barnwood gloucestershire his father was a music seller in the town who moved to 128 pall mall london four years later becoming a teacher of the flute charles the second son went to a village school near gloucester and afterwards to several institutions in london one of them was in kennington and kept by a mrs castlemaine who was astonished at his rapid progress from another he ran away but was captured at windsor not far from the theatre of his practical telegraph as a boy he was very shy and sensitive liking well to retire into an attic without any other company than his own thoughts wheatstone english concertina when he was about fourteen years old he was apprenticed to his uncle and namesake a maker and seller of musical instruments at 436 strand london but he showed little taste for handicraft or business and loved better to study books his father encouraged him in this and finally took him out of the uncle s charge at the age of fifteen wheatstone translated french poetry and wrote two songs one of which was given to his uncle who published it without knowing it as his nephew s composition some lines of his on the lyre became the motto of an engraving by bartolozzi small for his age but with a fine brow and intelligent blue eyes he often visited an old book stall in the vicinity of pall mall which was then a dilapidated and unpaved thoroughfare most of his pocket money was spent in purchasing the books which had taken his fancy whether fairy tales history or science one day to the surprise of the bookseller he coveted a volume on the discoveries of volta in electricity but not having the price he saved his pennies and secured the volume it was written in french and so he was obliged to save again until he could buy a dictionary then he began to read the volume and with the help of his elder brother william to repeat the experiments described in it with a home made battery in the scullery behind his father s house in constructing the battery the boy philosophers ran short of money to procure the requisite copper plates they had only a few copper coins left a happy thought occurred to charles who was the leading spirit in these researches we must use the pennies themselves said he and the battery was soon complete at christchurch marylebone on 12 february 1847 wheatstone was married to emma west she was the daughter of a taunton tradesman and of handsome appearance she died in 1866 leaving a family of five young children to his care his domestic life was quiet and uneventful though silent and reserved in public wheatstone was a clear and voluble talker in private if taken on his favourite studies and his small but active person his plain but intelligent countenance was full of animation sir henry taylor tells us that he once observed wheatstone at an evening party in oxford earnestly holding forth to lord palmerston on the capabilities of his telegraph you don t say so exclaimed the statesman i must get you to tell that to the lord chancellor and so saying he fastened the electrician on lord westbury and effected his escape a reminiscence of this interview may have prompted palmerston to remark that a time was coming when a minister might be asked in parliament if war had broken out in india and would reply wait a minute i ll just telegraph to the governor general and let you know wheatstone in later years wheatstone was knighted in 1868 after his completion of the automatic telegraph he had previously been made a chevalier of the legion of honour some thirty four distinctions and diplomas of home or foreign societies bore witness to his scientific reputation since 1836 he had been a fellow of the royal society and in 1859 he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences and in 1873 a foreign associate of the french academy of sciences the same year he was awarded the ampere medal by the french society for the encouragement of national industry in 1875 he was created an honorary member of the institution of civil engineers he was a d c l of oxford and an ll d of cambridge while on a visit to paris during the autumn of 1875 and engaged in perfecting his receiving instrument for submarine cables he caught a cold which produced inflammation of the lungs an illness from which he died in paris on 19 october 1875 a memorial service was held in the anglican chapel paris and attended by a deputation of the academy his remains were taken to his home in park crescent london marked by a blue plaque today and buried in kensal green cemetery in september 1821 wheatstone brought himself into public notice by exhibiting the enchanted lyre or aconcryptophone at a music shop at pall mall and in the adelaide gallery it consisted of a mimic lyre hung from the ceiling by a cord and emitting the strains of several instruments the piano harp and dulcimer in reality it was a mere sounding box and the cord was a steel rod that conveyed the vibrations of the music from the several instruments which were played out of sight and ear shot at this period wheatstone made numerous experiments on sound and its transmission some of his results are preserved in thomson s annals of philosophy for 1823 he recognised that sound is propagated by waves or oscillations of the atmosphere as light was then believed to be by undulations of the luminiferous ether water and solid bodies such as glass or metal or sonorous wood convey the modulations with high velocity and he conceived the plan of transmitting sound signals music or speech to long distances by this means he estimated that sound would travel 200 miles per second 320 km s through solid rods and proposed to telegraph from london to edinburgh in this way he even called his arrangement a telephone robert hooke in his micrographia published in 1667 writes i can assure the reader that i have by the help of a distended wire propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an instant or with as seemingly quick a motion as that of light nor was it essential the wire should be straight it might be bent into angles this property is the basis of the mechanical or lover s telephone said to have been known to the chinese many centuries ago hooke also considered the possibility of finding a way to quicken our powers of hearing a writer in the repository of arts for 1 september 1821 in referring to the enchanted lyre beholds the prospect of an opera being performed at the king s theatre and enjoyed at the hanover square rooms or even at the horns tavern kennington the vibrations are to travel through underground conductors like to gas in pipes and if music be capable of being thus conducted he observes perhaps the words of speech may be susceptible of the same means of propagation the eloquence of counsel the debates of parliament instead of being read the next day only but we shall lose ourselves in the pursuit of this curious subject besides transmitting sounds to a distance wheatstone devised a simple instrument for augmenting feeble sounds to which he gave the name of microphone it consisted of two slender rods which conveyed the mechanical vibrations to both ears and is quite different from the electrical microphone of professor hughes in 1823 his uncle the musical instrument maker died and wheatstone with his elder brother william took over the business charles had no great liking for the commercial part but his ingenuity found a vent in making improvements on the existing instruments and in devising philosophical toys he also invented instruments of his own one of the most famous was the wheatstone concertina it was a six sided instrument with 64 keys these keys provided for simple chromatic fingerings the english concertina became increasingly famous throughout his lifetime however it didn t reach its peak of popularity until the early 20th century in 1827 wheatstone introduced his kaleidophone a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye it consists of a metal rod carrying at its end a silvered bead which reflects a spot of light as the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures in the air like a spark whirled about in the darkness his photometer was probably suggested by this appliance it enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead which describes a narrow ellipse so as to draw the spots into parallel lines in 1828 wheatstone improved the german wind instrument called the mundharmonika until it became the popular concertina patented on 19 december 1829 the portable harmonium is another of his inventions which gained a prize medal at the great exhibition of 1851 he also improved the speaking machine of de kempelen and endorsed the opinion of sir david brewster that before the end of this century a singing and talking apparatus would be among the conquests of science in 1834 wheatstone who had won a name for himself was appointed to the chair of experimental physics in king s college london his first course of lectures on sound were a complete failure due to his abhorrence of public speaking in the rostrum he was tongue tied and incapable sometimes turning his back on the audience and mumbling to the diagrams on the wall in the laboratory he felt himself at home and ever after confined his duties mostly to demonstration he achieved renown by a great experiment made in 1834 the measurement of the velocity of electricity in a wire he cut the wire at the middle to form a gap which a spark might leap across and connected its ends to the poles of a leyden jar filled with electricity three sparks were thus produced one at each end of the wire and another at the middle he mounted a tiny mirror on the works of a watch so that it revolved at a high velocity and observed the reflections of his three sparks in it the points of the wire were so arranged that if the sparks were instantaneous their reflections would appear in one straight line but the middle one was seen to lag behind the others because it was an instant later the electricity had taken a certain time to travel from the ends of the wire to the middle this time was found by measuring the amount of lag and comparing it with the known velocity of the mirror having got the time he had only to compare that with the length of half the wire and he could find the velocity of electricity his results gave a calculated velocity of 288,000 miles per second i e faster than what we now know to be the speed of light 299,792.458 kilometres per second 186,000 mi s but were nonetheless an interesting approximation it was already appreciated by some scientists that the velocity of electricity was dependent on the properties of the conductor and its surroundings francis ronalds had observed signal retardation in his buried electric telegraph cable but not his airborne line in 1816 and outlined its cause to be induction wheatstone witnessed these experiments as a youth which were apparently a stimulus for his own research in telegraphy decades later after the telegraph had been commercialised michael faraday described how the velocity of an electric field in a submarine wire coated with insulator and surrounded with water is only 144,000 miles per second 232,000 km s or still less wheatstone s device of the revolving mirror was afterwards employed by l on foucault and hippolyte fizeau to measure the velocity of light wheatstone and others also contributed to early spectroscopy through the discovery and exploitation of spectral emission lines as john munro wrote in 1891 in 1835 at the dublin meeting of the british association wheatstone showed that when metals were volatilised in the electric spark their light examined through a prism revealed certain rays which were characteristic of them thus the kind of metals which formed the sparking points could be determined by analysing the light of the spark this suggestion has been of great service in spectrum analysis and as applied by robert bunsen gustav robert kirchhoff and others has led to the discovery of several new elements such as rubidium and thallium as well as increasing our knowledge of the heavenly bodies wheatstone abandoned his idea of transmitting intelligence by the mechanical vibration of rods and took up the electric telegraph in 1835 he lectured on the system of baron schilling and declared that the means were already known by which an electric telegraph could be made of great service to the world he made experiments with a plan of his own and not only proposed to lay an experimental line across the thames but to establish it on the london and birmingham railway before these plans were carried out however he received a visit from mr william fothergill cooke at his house in conduit street on 27 february 1837 which had an important influence on his future michael faraday t h huxley wheatstone david brewster and john tyndall r mr cooke was an officer in the madras army who being home on leave was attending some lectures on anatomy at the university of heidelberg where on 6 march 1836 he witnessed a demonstration with the telegraph of professor georg wilhelm munke and was so impressed with its importance that he forsook his medical studies and devoted all his efforts to the work of introducing the telegraph he returned to london soon after and was able to exhibit a telegraph with three needles in january 1837 feeling his want of scientific knowledge he consulted michael faraday and peter mark roget then secretary of the royal society the latter of whom sent him to wheatstone at a second interview mr cooke told wheatstone of his intention to bring out a working telegraph and explained his method wheatstone according to his own statement remarked to cooke that the method would not act and produced his own experimental telegraph finally cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership but wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply he was a well known man of science and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them cooke on the other hand declared that his sole object was to make a fortune from the scheme in may they agreed to join their forces wheatstone contributing the scientific and cooke the administrative talent the deed of partnership was dated 19 november 1837 a joint patent was taken out for their inventions including the five needle telegraph of wheatstone and an alarm worked by a relay in which the current by dipping a needle into mercury completed a local circuit and released the detent of a clockwork the five needle telegraph which was mainly if not entirely due to wheatstone was similar to that of schilling and based on the principle enunciated by andr marie amp re that is to say the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre according as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key the current deflected the needle to one side or the other there were five separate circuits actuating five different needles the latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon it in such a way that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it a double needle telegraph instrument of the type used on the great western railway an experimental line with a sixth return wire was run between the euston terminus and camden town station of the london and north western railway on 25 july 1837 the actual distance was only one and a half mile 2.4 km but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length it was late in the evening before the trial took place mr cooke was in charge at camden town while mr robert stephenson and other gentlemen looked on and wheatstone sat at his instrument in a dingy little room lit by a tallow candle near the booking office at euston wheatstone sent the first message to which cooke replied and never said wheatstone did i feel such a tumultuous sensation before as when all alone in the still room i heard the needles click and as i spelled the words i felt all the magnitude of the invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute in spite of this trial however the directors of the railway treated the new fangled invention with indifference and requested its removal in july 1839 however it was favoured by the great western railway and a line erected from the paddington station terminus to west drayton railway station a distance of thirteen miles 21 km part of the wire was laid underground at first but subsequently all of it was raised on posts along the line their circuit was eventually extended to slough in 1841 and was publicly exhibited at paddington as a marvel of science which could transmit fifty signals a distance of 280,000 miles per minute 7,500 km s the price of admission was a shilling 0.05 and in 1844 one fascinated observer recorded the following it is perfect from the terminus of the great western as far as slough that is eighteen miles the wires being in some places underground in tubes and in others high up in the air which last he says is by far the best plan we asked if the weather did not affect the wires but he said not a violent thunderstorm might ring a bell but no more we were taken into a small room we being mrs drummond miss philips harry codrington and myself and afterwards the milmans and mr rich where were several wooden cases containing different sorts of telegraphs in one sort every word was spelt and as each letter was placed in turn in a particular position the machinery caused the electric fluid to run down the line where it made the letter show itself at slough by what machinery he could not undertake to explain after each word came a sign from slough signifying i understand coming certainly in less than one second from the end of the word another prints the messages it brings so that if no one attended to the bell the message would not be lost this is effected by the electrical fluid causing a little hammer to strike the letter which presents itself the letter which is raised hits some manifold writing paper a new invention black paper which if pressed leaves an indelible black mark by which means the impression is left on white paper beneath this was the most ingenious of all and apparently mr wheatstone s favourite he was very good natured in explaining but understands it so well himself that he cannot feel how little we know about it and goes too fast for such ignorant folk to follow him in everything mrs drummond told me he is wonderful for the rapidity with which he thinks and his power of invention he invents so many things that he cannot put half his ideas into execution but leaves them to be picked up and used by others who get the credit of them the public took to the new invention after the capture of the murderer john tawell who in 1845 had become the first person to be arrested as the result of telecommunications technology in the same year wheatstone introduced two improved forms of the apparatus namely the single and the double needle instruments in which the signals were made by the successive deflections of the needles of these the single needle instrument requiring only one wire is still in use the development of the telegraph may be gathered from two facts in 1855 the death of the emperor nicholas at st petersburg about one o clock in the afternoon was announced in the house of lords a few hours later the result of the oaks of 1890 was received in new york fifteen seconds after the horses passed the winning post in 1841 a difference arose between cooke and wheatstone as to the share of each in the honour of inventing the telegraph the question was submitted to the arbitration of the famous engineer marc isambard brunel on behalf of cooke and professor daniell of king s college the inventor of the daniell battery on the part of wheatstone they awarded to cooke the credit of having introduced the telegraph as a useful undertaking which promised to be of national importance and to wheatstone that of having by his researches prepared the public to receive it they concluded with the words it is to the united labours of two gentlemen so well qualified for mutual assistance that we must attribute the rapid progress which this important invention has made during five years since they have been associated the decision however vague pronounces the needle telegraph a joint production if it had mainly been invented by wheatstone it was chiefly introduced by cooke their respective shares in the undertaking might be compared to that of an author and his publisher but for the fact that cooke himself had a share in the actual work of invention from 1836 7 wheatstone had thought a good deal about submarine telegraphs and in 1840 he gave evidence before the railway committee of the house of commons on the feasibility of the proposed line from dover to calais he had even designed the machinery for making and laying the cable in the autumn of 1844 with the assistance of mr j d llewellyn he submerged a length of insulated wire in swansea bay and signalled through it from a boat to the mumbles lighthouse next year he suggested the use of gutta percha for the coating of the intended wire across the english channel in 1840 wheatstone had patented an alphabetical telegraph or wheatstone a b c instrument which moved with a step by step motion and showed the letters of the message upon a dial the same principle was used in his type printing telegraph patented in 1841 this was the first apparatus which printed a telegram in type it was worked by two circuits and as the type revolved a hammer actuated by the current pressed the required letter on the paper the introduction of the telegraph had so far advanced that on 2 september 1845 the electric telegraph company was registered and wheatstone by his deed of partnership with cooke received a sum of 33,000 for the use of their joint inventions in 1859 wheatstone was appointed by the board of trade to report on the subject of the atlantic cables and in 1864 he was one of the experts who advised the atlantic telegraph company on the construction of the successful lines of 1865 and 1866 in 1870 the electric telegraph lines of the united kingdom worked by different companies were transferred to the post office and placed under government control wheatstone further invented the automatic transmitter in which the signals of the message are first punched out on a strip of paper which is then passed through the sending key and controls the signal currents by substituting a mechanism for the hand in sending the message he was able to telegraph about 100 words a minute or five times the ordinary rate in the postal telegraph service this apparatus is employed for sending press telegrams and it has recently been so much improved that messages are now sent from london to bristol at a speed of 600 words a minute and even of 400 words a minute between london and aberdeen on the night of 8 april 1886 when mr gladstone introduced his bill for home rule in ireland no fewer than 1,500,000 words were dispatched from the central station at st martin s le grand by 100 wheatstone transmitters the plan of sending messages by a running strip of paper which actuates the key was originally patented by bain in 1846 but wheatstone aided by mr augustus stroh an accomplished mechanician and an able experimenter was the first to bring the idea into successful operation this system is often referred to as the wheatstone perforator and is the forerunner of the stock market ticker tape charles wheatstone mirror stereoscope stereopsis was first described by wheatstone in 1838 in 1840 he was awarded the royal medal of the royal society for his explanation of binocular vision a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope he showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of our eyes from different points of view thus in the stereoscope an arrangement of lenses or mirrors two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect sir david brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors and bringing it into its existing form with lenses the pseudoscope wheatstone coined the term from the greek was introduced in 1852 and is in some sort the reverse of the stereoscope since it causes a solid object to seem hollow and a nearer one to be farther off thus a bust appears to be a mask and a tree growing outside of a window looks as if it were growing inside the room its purpose was to test his theory of stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be called experimental psychology in 1840 wheatstone introduced his chronoscope for measuring minute intervals of time which was used in determining the speed of a bullet or the passage of a star in this apparatus an electric current actuated an electro magnet which noted the instant of an occurrence by means of a pencil on a moving paper it is said to have been capable of distinguishing 1 7300 part of a second 137 microsecond and the time a body took to fall from a height of one inch 25 mm on 26 november 1840 he exhibited his electro magnetic clock in the library of the royal society and propounded a plan for distributing the correct time from a standard clock to a number of local timepieces the circuits of these were to be electrified by a key or contact maker actuated by the arbour of the standard and their hands corrected by electro magnetism the following january alexander bain took out a patent for an electro magnetic clock and he subsequently charged wheatstone with appropriating his ideas it appears that bain worked as a mechanist to wheatstone from august to december 1840 and he asserted that he had communicated the idea of an electric clock to wheatstone during that period but wheatstone maintained that he had experimented in that direction during may bain further accused wheatstone of stealing his idea of the electro magnetic printing telegraph but wheatstone showed that the instrument was only a modification of his own electro magnetic telegraph in 1840 alexander bain mentioned to the mechanics magazine editor his financial problems he introduced him to sir charles wheatstone bain demonstrated his models to wheatstone who when asked for his opinion said oh i shouldn t bother to develop these things any further there s no future in them 2 three months later wheatstone demonstrated an electric clock to the royal society claiming it was his own invention however bain had already applied for a patent for it wheatstone tried to block bain s patents but failed when wheatstone organised an act of parliament to set up the electric telegraph company the house of lords summoned bain to give evidence and eventually compelled the company to pay bain 10,000 and give him a job as manager causing wheatstone to resign one of wheatstone s most ingenious devices was the polar clock exhibited at the meeting of the british association in 1848 it is based on the fact discovered by sir david brewster that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun it follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north the position of the sun although beneath the horizon could be determined and the apparent solar time obtained the clock consisted of a spyglass having a nicol double image prism for an eyepiece and a thin plate of selenite for an object glass when the tube was directed to the north pole that is parallel to the earth s axis and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen the angle of turning as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb gave the hour of day the device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875 1876 north polar expedition commanded by captain nares in 1843 wheatstone communicated an important paper to the royal society entitled an account of several new processes for determining the constants of a voltaic circuit it contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor which still goes by the name of wheatstone s bridge or balance although it was first devised by samuel hunter christie of the royal military academy woolwich who published it in the philosophical transactions for 1833 the method was neglected until wheatstone brought it into notice his paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of ohm he introduced a unit of resistance namely a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains 6.5 g and showed how it might be applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance he was awarded a medal for his paper by the society the same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of a thermometer or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an electric contact made by the mercury a sound telegraph in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell was also patented by cooke and wheatstone in may of that year wheatstone s remarkable ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of cyphers he was responsible for the then unusual playfair cipher named after his friend lord playfair it was used by the militaries of several nations through at least world war i and is known to have been used during world war ii by british intelligence services it was initially resistant to cryptoanalysis but methods were eventually developed to break it he also became involved in the interpretation of cypher manuscripts in the british museum he devised a cryptograph or machine for turning a message into cypher which could only be interpreted by putting the cypher into a corresponding machine adjusted to decrypt it in 1840 wheatstone brought out his magneto electric machine for generating continuous currents on 4 february 1867 he published the principle of reaction in the dynamo electric machine by a paper to the royal society but mr c w siemens had communicated the identical discovery ten days earlier and both papers were read on the same day it afterwards appeared that werner von siemens samuel alfred varley and wheatstone had independently arrived at the principle within a few months of each other varley patented it on 24 december 1866 siemens called attention to it on 17 january 1867 and wheatstone exhibited it in action at the royal society on the above date wheatstone was involved in various disputes with other scientists through his life regarding his role in different technologies and appeared at times to take more credit than he was due as well as william fothergill cooke alexander bain and david brewster mentioned above these also included francis ronalds at the kew observatory wheatstone was erroneously believed by many to have created the atmospheric electricity observing apparatus that ronalds invented and developed at the observatory in the 1840s and also to have installed the first automatically recording meteorological instruments there see for example
