from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a diurnal cycle is any pattern that recurs every 24 hours as a result of one full rotation of the earth with respect to the sun in climatology the diurnal cycle is one of the most basic forms of climate patterns the most familiar such pattern is the diurnal temperature variation such a cycle may be approximately sinusoidal or include components of a truncated sinusoid due to the sun s rising and setting and thermal relaxation newton cooling at night diurnal cycles of environmental conditions light or temperature can result in similar cycles in dependent biological processes such as photosynthesis in plants or clinical depression in humans plant responses to environmental cycles may even induce indirect cycles in rhizosphere microbial activities including nitrogen fixation a semi diurnal cycle refers to a pattern that occurs about every twelve hours or about twice a day often these can be related to lunar tides in which case the interval is closer to 12 hours and 25 minutes chronotype circadian rhythm diel vertical migration v t e climate oscillations climate oscillations 8.2 kiloyear event antarctic circumpolar wave antarctic oscillation arctic dipole anomaly arctic oscillation atlantic equatorial mode atlantic multidecadal oscillation earth s axial tilt bond event dansgaard oeschger event diurnal cycle diurnal temperature variation el ni o southern oscillation el ni o la ni a equatorial indian ocean oscillation glacial cycles indian ocean dipole madden julian oscillation milankovitch cycles monsoon north atlantic oscillation north pacific oscillation orbital forcing pacific decadal oscillation pacific north american teleconnection pattern quasi biennial oscillation seasonal lag seasons solar variability this climatology meteorology related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title diurnal cycle oldid 830951488 categories climate patternsatmospheric science stubshidden categories all stub articles
