from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the penumbral lunar eclipse on march 14 2006 was a total penumbral eclipse a total penumbral eclipse is a lunar eclipse that occurs when the moon becomes completely immersed in the penumbral cone of the earth without touching the umbra it is a narrow path for the moon to pass within the penumbra and outside the umbra it can happen on the earth s northern or southern penumbral edges in addition the size of the penumbra is sometimes too small where the moon enters it to contain the moon the width of the earth s penumbra is determined by the sun s angular diameter at the time of the eclipse and the moon s angular diameter is larger than the sun over part of its elliptical orbit depending on whether the eclipse occurs at its nearest perigee or farthest point apogee in its orbit around the earth the majority of the time the size of the moon and the size of the earth s penumbra where the moon crosses it mean that most eclipses will not be total penumbral in nature contents such eclipses constitute a relatively small fraction of lunar eclipses and the distribution of these events is uneven occurring between 0 and 9 times per century the period of this variation is about 600 years and also correlates with the frequency of total umbral eclipses and tetrads the maximum number in fred s 5k canon https eclipse gsfc
