from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a lunar mansion is a segment of the ecliptic often called a station or house through which the moon passes in its orbit around earth often used by ancient cultures as part of their calendar system in general though not always the zodiac is divided into 27 or 28 segments relative to the fixed stars one for each day of the lunar month a sidereal month lasts about 27.3 days the moon s position is charted with respect to those fixed segments since the moon s position at given stage will vary according to earth s position in its own orbit the lunar mansions are an effective system for keeping track of the passage of seasons various cultures have used sets of lunar mansions astrologically for example the jyotisha astrological nakshatras of hindu culture the arabic manzils manazil al qamar the 28 mansions of chinese astronomy and the 36 decans of egyptian astronomy western astrology does not use mansions but each zodiac sign covers 2 or 3 mansions the chinese system groups mansions into four groups related to the seasons the concept of the lunar mansions are considered to be babylonian in origin in his a history of western astrology jim tester explains that they appear in hellenistic astrology in the 2nd century list of fixed stars in the katarchai by maximus the poet and astrologer not to be confounded with maximus of tyre the arabic lists by alchandri and haly abenragel and a similar coptic list with greek names tester believes that though they were known in vedic india all lists seem to betray transmission through greek sources though pointing out that the babylonians had well established lunar groupings by the 6th century bc he also notes that the 28 mansion scheme was derived via egyptian magic by the linking of the lists of lucky and unlucky days of the lunar month with the hemerologies and with the zodiac contents main article twenty eight mansions the 28 lunar mansions chinese rsh b xi are the chinese and east asian form of the lunar mansions they can be considered as the equivalent to the western zodiac although the 28 mansions reflect the movement of the moon through a sidereal month rather than the sun in a solar year in their final form they embodied the astral forms of the four symbols two real and two legendary animals important in traditional chinese culture such as fengshui main article nakshatra the nakshatras or n k atras lit stars are the indian form of the lunar mansions they usually number 27 but sometimes 28 and their names are related to the most prominent constellations in each sector they start from a point on the ecliptic precisely opposite the star spica sanskrit chitr and develop eastwards in classical hindu mythology the creation of the nakshatras is attributed to daksha they were wives of chandra the moon god the nakshatras of traditional bhartiya astronomy are based on a list of 28 asterisms found in the atharvaveda av 19.7 and also in the shatapatha brahmana the first astronomical text that lists them is the vedanga jyotisha the mansions are important parts of indian astrology in the traditional arabic astrological system which was derived from the indian nakshatra system the moon was seen to move through 28 distinct manazil singular manzil house during the normal solar year each manzil lasting therefore for about 13 days one or more manazil were then grouped into a nawaa plural anwaa which were tied to a given weather pattern in other words the yearly pattern was divided in the following manner a year was divided into anwaa each of which was made up of one more manazil which were associated with a dominant star or constellation these stars and constellations were sometimes but not always connected in some way to constellations in the zodiac moreover as the anwaa repeat on a regular solar cycle they can be correlated to fixed points on the gregorian calendar the following table is a breakdown of the anwaa and their position on the gregorian calendar manzil associated nawaa significant stars constellations zodiac constellations begins on sheratan al thuraya sheratan in aries 17 may pleione al thuraya
