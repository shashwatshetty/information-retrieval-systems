and when to remove this template message a graphic depicting the new moon phase in astronomy the new moon is the first lunar phase when the moon and sun have the same ecliptic longitude at this phase the lunar disk is not visible to the unaided eye except when silhouetted during a solar eclipse daylight outshines the earthlight that dimly illuminates the dark side of the new moon the actual phase is usually a very thin crescent because the moon rarely passes directly in front of the sun except in a solar eclipse the original meaning of the term new moon which is still sometimes used in non astronomical contexts was the first visible crescent of the moon after conjunction with the sun this crescent moon is briefly visible when low above the western horizon shortly after sunset and before moonset a lunation or synodic month is the average time from one new moon to the next in the j2000.0 epoch the average length of a lunation is 29.530588 days or 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes and 2.8 seconds however the length of any one synodic month can vary from 29.26 to 29.80 days due to the perturbing effects of the sun s gravity on the moon s eccentric orbit in a lunar calendar each month corresponds to a lunation each lunar cycle can be assigned a unique lunation number to identify it contents this article contains instructions advice or how to content january 2018 the length of a lunation is about 29.53 days its precise duration is linked to many phenomena in nature such as the variation between spring and neap tides the extreme highest and lowest tides respectively an approximate formula to compute the mean moments of new moon conjunction between sun and moon for successive months is where n is an integer starting with 0 for the first new moon in the year 2000 and that is incremented by 1 for each successive synodic month and the result d is the number of days and fractions since 2000-01-01 00 00 00 reckoned in the time scale known as terrestrial time tt used in ephemerides to obtain this moment expressed in universal time ut world clock time add the result of following approximate correction to the result d obtained above days periodic perturbations change the time of true conjunction from these mean values for all new moons between 1601 and 2401 the maximum difference is 0.592 days 14h13m in either direction the duration of a lunation i e the time from new moon to the next new moon varies in this period between 29.272 and 29.833 days i e 0.259d 6h12m shorter or 0.302d 7h15m longer than average this range is smaller than the difference between mean and true conjunction because during one lunation the periodic terms cannot all change to their maximum opposite value see the article on the full moon cycle for a fairly simple method to compute the moment of new moon more accurately the long term error of the formula is approximately 1 cy2 seconds in tt and 11 cy2 seconds in ut cy is centuries since 2000 see section explanation of the formulae for details the moment of mean conjunction can easily be computed from an expression for the mean ecliptical longitude of the moon minus the mean ecliptical longitude of the sun delauney parameter d jean meeus gave formulae to compute this in his astronomical formulae for calculators based on the ephemerides of brown and newcomb ca 1900 and in his 1st edition of astronomical algorithms based on the elp2000-85 the 2nd edition uses elp2000-82 with improved expressions from chapront et al in 1998 these are now outdated chapront et al 2002 published improved parameters also meeus s formula uses a fractional variable to allow computation of the four main phases and uses a second variable for the secular terms for the convenience of the reader the formula given above is based on chapront s latest parameters and expressed with a single integer variable and the following additional terms have been added constant term like meeus apply the constant terms of the aberration of light for the sun s motion and light time correction for the moon to obtain the apparent difference in ecliptical longitudes sun 20.496 moon 0.704 correction in conjunction 0.000451 days for ut at 1 january 2000 t tt ut was 63.83 s hence the correction for the clock time ut tt t of the conjunction is 0.000739 days quadratic term in elp2000 85 see chapront et alii 1988 d has a quadratic term of 5.8681 t2 expressed in lunations n this yields a correction of 87.40310 12n2 days to the time of conjunction the term includes a tidal contribution of 0.5 23.8946 cy2 the most current estimate from lunar laser ranging for the acceleration is see chapront et alii 2002 25.858 0.003 cy2 therefore the new quadratic term of d is -6.8498 t2 indeed the polynomial provided by chapront et alii 2002 provides the same value their table 4 this translates to a correction of 14.62210 12n2 days to the time of conjunction the quadratic term now is 102.02610 12n2 days for ut analysis of historical observations shows that t has a long term increase of 31 s cy2 converted to days and lunations the correction from et to ut becomes 23510 12n2 days the theoretical tidal contribution to t is about 42 s cy2 the smaller observed value is thought to be mostly due to changes in the shape of the earth because the discrepancy is not fully explained uncertainty of our prediction of ut rotation angle of the earth may be as large as the difference between these values 11 s cy2 the error in the position of the moon itself is only maybe 0.5 cy2 or because the apparent mean angular velocity of the moon is about 0.5 s 1 s cy2 in the time of conjunction with the sun this section needs additional citations for verification may 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message the lunation number or lunation cycle is a number given to each lunation beginning from a certain one in history several conventions are in use the most commonly used is the brown lunation number bln which defines lunation 1 as beginning at the first new moon of 1923 the year when ernest william brown s lunar theory was introduced in the major national astronomical almanacs lunation 1 occurred at approximately 02 41 utc january 17 1923 new moons occur on julian dates with the given uncertainty due to varying torques from the sun another increasingly popular lunation number simply called the lunation number introduced by jean meeus defines lunation 0 as beginning on the first new moon of 2000 this occurred at approximately 18 14 utc january 6 2000 the formula relating this lunation number with the brown lunation number is bln ln 953 the goldstine lunation number refers to the lunation numbering used by herman goldstine in his 1973 book new and full moons 1001 b c to a d 1651 with lunation 0 beginning on january 11 1001 bc and can be calculated using gln ln 37105 the hebrew lunation number is the count of lunations in the hebrew calendar with lunation 1 beginning on october 7 3761 bc it can be calculated using hln ln 71234 the islamic lunation number is the count of lunations in the islamic calendar with lunation 1 as beginning on july 16 622 it can be calculated using iln ln 17038 the thai lunation number is called maasa kendha defines lunation 0 as beginning of the southeast asian calendar on sunday march 22 638 julian calendar it can be calculated using tln ln 16843 see also lunar calendar this section needs additional citations for verification may 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message in non astronomical contexts new moon refers to the first visible crescent of the moon after conjunction with the sun this takes place over the western horizon in a brief period between sunset and moonset and therefore the precise time and even the date of the appearance of the new moon by this definition will be influenced by the geographical location of the observer the astronomical new moon sometimes known as the dark moon to avoid confusion occurs by definition at the moment of conjunction in ecliptical longitude with the sun when the moon is invisible from the earth this moment is unique and does not depend on location and in certain circumstances it coincides with a solar eclipse in the above meaning the first crescent marks the beginning of the month in the islamic calendar and in some lunisolar calendars such as the hebrew calendar in the chinese calendar the beginning of the month is marked by the dark moon the new moon is also important in astrology as is the full moon the new moon is significant in the hindu calendar people generally wait for the new moon to begin projects as the waxing period of the moon is considered to be favorable for new work there are fifteen moon dates for each of the waxing and waning periods these fifteen dates divided evenly into five categories nanda bhadra jaya rikta and purna which are cycled through in that order nanda dates are considered to be favorable for auspicious works bhadra dates for works related with community social family friends and jaya dates for dealing with conflict rikta dates are considered beneficial only for works related to cruelty purna dates are considered to be favorable for all work the first day of the lunar hindu calendar starts the day after the new moon amavasya which is considered a powerful force for good or evil the hindu epic mahabharatha states that the kurukshetra war started this day which was also a tuesday mangalvaar day of the week named after mars the islamic calendar has retained an observational definition of the new moon marking the new month when the first crescent moon is actually seen and making it impossible to be certain in advance of when a specific month will begin in particular the exact date on which ramadan will begin is not known in advance in saudi arabia the new king abdullah centre for crescent observations and astronomy in makkah has a clock for addressing this as an international scientific project in pakistan there is a central ruet e hilal committee whose head is mufti muneeb ur rehman assisted by 150 observatories of the pakistan meteorological department which announces the sighting of the new moon since its creation in 1974 the status of the central ruet e hilal committee has been controversial as it refused the witnesses shahadats from other sects in iran a special committee receives observations of every new moon to determine the beginning of each month this committee uses one hundred groups of observers an attempt to unify muslims on a scientifically calculated worldwide calendar was adopted by both the fiqh council of north america and the european council for fatwa and research in 2007 the new calculation requires that conjunction occur before sunset in mecca saudi arabia and that moonset on the following day must take place after sunset these can be precisely calculated and therefore a unified calendar is imminent if it becomes adopted worldwide the new moon is the beginning of the month in the chinese calendar some buddhist chinese keep a vegetarian diet on the new moon and full moon each month main article rosh chodesh the new moon signifies the start of every jewish month and is considered an important date and minor holiday in the hebrew calendar the modern form of the calendar is a rule based lunisolar calendar akin to the chinese calendar measuring months defined in lunar cycles as well as years measured in solar cycles and distinct from the purely lunar islamic calendar and the predominantly solar gregorian calendar the jewish calendar is calculated based on mathematical rules designed to ensure that festivals are observed in their traditional season passover always falls in the springtime this fixed lunisolar calendar follows rules introduced by hillel ii and refined until the ninth century this calculation makes use of a mean lunation length used by ptolemy and handed down from babylonians which is still very accurate ca 29.530594 days vs a present value see below of 29.530589 days this difference of only 0.0000005 or five millionths of a day adds up to about only four hours since babylonian times the messianic pentecostal group the new israelites of peru keeps the new moon as a sabbath of rest as an evangelical church it follows the bible s teachings that god sanctified the seventh day sabbath and the new moons in addition to it see ezekiel 46 1 3 no work may be done from dusk until dusk and the services run for 11 hours although a large number spend 24 hours within the gates of the temples sleeping and singing praises throughout the night in the bah faith effective from 2015 onwards the twin holy birthdays referring to two successive holy days in the bah calendar the birth of the b b and the birth of bah u ll h will be observed on the first and the second day following the occurrence of the eighth new moon after naw r z bah new year as determined in advance by astronomical tables using tehran as the point of reference this will result in the observance of the twin birthdays moving year to year from mid october to mid november
