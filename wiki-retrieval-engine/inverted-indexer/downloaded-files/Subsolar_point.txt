from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a basic diagram showing the location of the subsolar point on the earth s surface the angle between the sun and the local ground level is exactly 90 at the subsolar point the subsolar point on a planet is where its sun is perceived to be directly overhead in zenith that is where the sun s rays are hitting the planet exactly perpendicular to its surface it can also mean the point closest to the sun on an object in space even though the sun might not be visible for planets with an orientation and rotation similar to the earth s the subsolar point will move westward circling the globe once a day approximately moving along a circle of latitude however it will also move north and south between the tropics over the course of a year so it is spiraling like a helix the december solstice occurs when the subsolar point is on the tropic of capricorn and the june solstice is at the instant when the subsolar point is on the tropic of cancer the march and september equinoxes occur when the subsolar point crosses the equator when the point passes through hawaii the only u s state in which this happens it is known as lahaina noon day and night world map shows location of subsolar point for any user specified time this astronomy related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title subsolar point oldid 811897122 categories spherical astronomyearthcelestial coordinate systemastronomy stubshidden categories all stub articles
