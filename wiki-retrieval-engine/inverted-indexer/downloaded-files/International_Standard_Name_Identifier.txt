databases using numerous private and public identification systems under the isni system he or she would have a single linking isni record the many different databases could then exchange data about that particular identity without resorting to messy methods such as comparing text strings an often quoted example in the english language world is the difficulty faced when identifying john smith in a database while there may be many records for john smith it is not always clear which record refers to the specific john smith that is required if an author has published under several different names or pseudonyms each such name will receive its own isni isni can be used by libraries and archives when sharing catalogue information for more precise searching for information online and in
