while a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of canada the name is now accepted as coming from the st lawrence iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement in 1535 indigenous inhabitants of the present day quebec city region used the word to direct french explorer jacques cartier to the village of stadacona cartier later used the word canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to donnacona the chief at stadacona by 1545 european books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the saint lawrence river as canada from the 16th to the early 18th century canada referred to the part of new france that lay along the saint lawrence river in 1791 the area became two british colonies called upper canada and lower canada collectively named the canadas until their union as the british province of canada in 1841 upon confederation in 1867 canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the london conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country s title the transition away from the use of dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the canada act which refers only to canada later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from dominion day to canada day the term dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces though after the second world war the term federal had replaced dominion main article history of canada see also timeline of canadian history and list of years in canada further information historiography of canada linguistic areas of north american indigenous peoples at the time of european contact indigenous peoples in present day canada include the first nations inuit and m tis the latter being a mixed blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when first nations and inuit people married european settlers the term aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents including the constitution act 1982 the first inhabitants of north america are generally hypothesized to have migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival the paleo indian archaeological sites at old crow flats and bluefish caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in canada the characteristics of canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks some of these cultures had collapsed by the time european explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations the indigenous population at the time of the first european settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million with a figure of 500,000 accepted by canada s royal commission on aboriginal peoples as a consequence of european colonization the population of canada s indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent and several first nations such as the beothuk disappeared the decline is attributed to several causes including the transfer of european diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity conflicts over the fur trade conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations self sufficiency although not without conflict european canadians early interactions with first nations and inuit populations were relatively peaceful first nations and m tis peoples played a critical part in the development of european colonies in canada particularly for their role in assisting european coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the north american fur trade the crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the european colonization period though the inuit in general had more limited interaction with european settlers however from the late 18th century european canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture these attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations a period of redress is underway which started with the appointment of the truth and reconciliation commission of canada by the government of canada in 2008 the first known attempt at european colonization began when norsemen settled briefly at l anse aux meadows in newfoundland around 1000 ad no further european exploration occurred until 1497 when italian seafarer john cabot explored and claimed canada s atlantic coast in the name of king henry vii of england then basque and portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the atlantic coast in the early 16th century in 1534 french explorer jacques cartier explored the gulf of saint lawrence where on july 24 he planted a 10 metre 33 ft cross bearing the words long live the king of france and took possession of the territory new france in the name of king francis i in general the settlements appear to have been short lived possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in scandinavia and northern canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time in 1583 sir humphrey gilbert by the royal prerogative of queen elizabeth i founded st john s newfoundland as the first north american english colony french explorer samuel de champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent european settlements at port royal in 1605 and quebec city in 1608 among the colonists of new france canadiens extensively settled the saint lawrence river valley

and most of new france came under british rule in 1763 after the seven years war the royal proclamation of 1763 established first nation treaty rights created the province of quebec out of new france and annexed cape breton island to nova scotia st john s island now prince edward island became a separate colony in 1769 to avert conflict in quebec the british parliament passed the quebec act of 1774 expanding quebec s territory to the great lakes and ohio valley more importantly the quebec act afforded quebec special autonomy and rights of self administration at a time that the thirteen colonies were increasingly agitating against british rule it re established the french language catholic faith and french civil law there staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the thirteen colonies the proclamation and the quebec act in turn angered many residents of the thirteen colonies further fuelling anti british sentiment in the years prior to the american revolution after the successful american war of independence the 1783 treaty of paris recognized the independence of the newly formed united state and set the terms of peace ceding british north american territories south of the great lakes to the new country the american war of independence also caused a large out migration of loyalists the settlers who had fought against american independence many moved to canada particularly atlantic canada where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories new brunswick was in turn split from nova scotia as part of a reorganization of loyalist settlements in the maritimes to accommodate the influx of english speaking loyalists in central canada the constitutional act of 1791 divided the province of canada into french speaking lower canada later quebec and english speaking upper canada later ontario granting each its own elected legislative assembly the canadas were the main front in the war of 1812 between the united states and the united kingdom peace came in 1815 no boundaries were changed immigration resumed at a higher level with over 960,000 arrivals from britain between 1815 50 new arrivals included refugees escaping the great irish famine as well as gaelic speaking scots displaced by the highland clearances infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of europeans who immigrated to canada before 1891 the desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive rebellions of 1837 the durham report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of french canadians into english culture the act of union merged the canadas into a united province of canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of british north america by 1849 the signing of the oregon treaty by britain and the united states in 1846 ended the oregon boundary dispute extending the border westward along the 49th parallel this paved the way for
