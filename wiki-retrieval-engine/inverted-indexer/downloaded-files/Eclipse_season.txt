from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search an eclipse season is one of only two periods during a year when eclipses can occur due to the orbital inclination of the moon each season lasts for approximately 34 days and repeats just short of six months thus two full eclipse seasons always occur each year either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season during the eclipse season the inclination of the moon s orbit is low hence the sun moon and earth become aligned straight enough in syzygy for an eclipse to occur during each season the type of solar eclipse whether total or annular as seen from the sublunar point depends on the apparent sizes of the sun and moon which is a function of the elliptical distance of earth from the sun and of the moon from earth respectively as seen from earth s surface if the earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the sun if the moon s orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the earth and if both orbits were coplanar on the same plane with each other then two eclipses would happen every lunar month 29.53 days a lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon a solar eclipse every new moon and all solar eclipses would be the same type contents an eclipse season is the only time during which the sun from the perspective of the earth is close enough to one of the moon s nodes to allow for an eclipse to occur during the season whenever there is a full moon a lunar eclipse will occur and whenever there is a new moon a solar eclipse will occur if the sun is close enough to a node then a total eclipse will occur each season lasts from 31 to 37 days recurring about every 6 months at least two one solar and one lunar in any order and at most three eclipses solar lunar then solar again or vice versa will occur during every eclipse season this is because it is about 15 days a fortnight between full moon and new moon and vice versa if there is an eclipse at the very beginning of the season then there is enough time 30 days for two more eclipses in other words because the eclipse season 34 days long on average is longer than the synodic month one lunation or the time for the moon to return to a particular phase and about 29.5 days the moon will be new or full at least two and up to three times during the season eclipse seasons occur slightly shy of six months apart successively occurring every 173.31 days half of an eclipse year the time it takes the sun to travel from one node to the next along the ecliptic if the last eclipse of an eclipse season occurs at the very beginning of a calendar year it is possible for a total of seven eclipses to occur since there is still time before the end of the calendar year for two full eclipse seasons each having up to three eclipses in each sequence below each eclipse is separated by a fortnight the first and last eclipse in each sequence is separated by one synodic month see also eclipse cycles eclipse season of may june 2002 may 26th descending node full moon june 10th ascending node new moon june 24th descending node full moon penumbral lunar eclipse lunar saros 111 annular solar eclipse solar saros 137 penumbral lunar eclipse lunar saros 149 eclipse season of june july 2011 june 1st descending node new moon june 15th ascending node full moon july 1st descending node new moon partial solar eclipse solar saros 118 total lunar eclipse lunar saros 130 partial solar eclipse solar saros 156 the two eclipse seasons above share similarities lunar or solar centrality and gamma of each eclipse in the same column because they are a half saros apart date type phase time of season next eclipse will occur april 25 2013 lunar full beginning next new moon may 10 2013 solar new middle next full moon may 25 2013 lunar full end next eclipse season no eclipses for about 5 months october 18 2013 lunar full beginning next new moon november 3 2013 solar new end next eclipse season no eclipses for about 5 and a half months april 15 2014 lunar full beginning next new moon april 29 2014 solar new end next eclipse season no eclipses for about 5 and a half months october 8 2014 lunar full beginning next new moon october 23 2014 solar new end next eclipse season spring of 2015 the partial lunar eclipse of august 7-8 2017 is followed by the solar eclipse of august 21 2017 eclipse cycle ecliptic lunar node lunar phase orbit of the moon orbital inclination syzygy nasa eclipse web site sun centered animation of moon inclination unl astronomy solar eclipses a multimillenium tale of computation retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title eclipse season oldid 818312800 categories eclipsesmoontime in astronomyunits of time
