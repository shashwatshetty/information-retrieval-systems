prototype of the t tauri stars it was discovered in october 1852 by john russell hind t tauri appears from earth amongst the hyades cluster not far from tauri but it is actually 420 light years behind it and was not formed with the rest of them faint nebulosity around t tauri is a herbig haro object called burnham s nebula or hh 255 like all t tauri stars it is very young being only a million years old its distance from earth is about 460 light years and its apparent magnitude varies unpredictably from about 9.3 to 14 the t tauri system consists of at least three stars only one of which is visible at optical wavelengths the other two shine in the infrared and one of them also emits radio waves through vla radio observations it was found that the young star the t tauri star itself dramatically changed its orbit after a close encounter with one of its companions and may have been ejected from the system a widefield image showing the reflection nebula and clouds of dust credit adam block mount lemmon skycenter university of arizona physically nearby is ngc 1555 a reflection nebula known as hind s nebula or hind s variable nebula it is illuminated by t tauri and thus also varies in brightness the nebula ngc 1554 was likewise associated with t tauri and was observed in 1868 by otto wilhelm von struve but soon disappeared or perhaps never existed and is known as struve s lost nebula the t tauri wind so named because this young star is currently in this stage is a phase of stellar development between the accretion of material from the slowing rotating material of a solar nebula and the ignition of the hydrogen that has agglomerated into the protostar a protostar is the denser parts of a cloud core typically with a mass around 104 solar masses in the form of gas and dust that collapses under its own weight gravity and continues to attract matter the protostar at first only has about 1 of its final mass but the envelope of the star continues to grow as infalling material is accreted after a few million years thermonuclear fusion begins in its core then a strong stellar wind is produced which stops the infall of new mass the protostar is now considered a young star since its mass is fixed and its future evolution is now set p cygni profile aavso variable star of the month profile of t tauri http www kencroswell com ttauri html http www
