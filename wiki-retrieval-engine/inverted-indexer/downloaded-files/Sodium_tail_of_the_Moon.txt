from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the moon has been shown to have a tail of sodium atoms too faint to be detected by the human eye hundreds of thousands of kilometers long the feature was discovered in 1998 as a result of scientists from boston university observing the leonid meteor shower the moon is constantly releasing atomic sodium as a fine dust from its surface due to photon stimulated desorption solar wind sputtering and meteorite impacts solar radiation pressure accelerates the sodium atoms away from the sun forming an elongated tail toward the antisolar direction the continual impacts of small meteorites produce a constant tail from the moon but the leonids have intensified it thus making it more observable from earth than usual atmosphere of the moon lunar atmosphere and dust environment explorer v t e the moon physical properties internal structure topography atmosphere gravity field hill sphere magnetic field sodium tail moonlight earthshine orbit orbital elements distance perigee apogee nodes nodal period precession syzygy new moon full moon eclipses lunar eclipse total penumbral lunar eclipse tetrad solar eclipse solar eclipses on the moon eclipse cycle supermoon tide tidal force tidal locking tidal acceleration tidal range lunar mansion surface features selenography terminator hemispheres near side far side poles north pole south pole face maria list mountains peak of eternal light valleys volcanic features domes calderas craters list ray systems crater of eternal darkness shackleton crater south pole aitken basin soil swirls rilles wrinkle ridges rocks lunar basalt 70017 water space weathering micrometeorite sputtering quakes transient lunar phenomenon science observation libration lunar theory origin giant impact hypothesis theia lunar magma ocean geology timescale late heavy bombardment lunar meteorites kreep experiments lunar laser ranging alsep lunar sample displays apollo 11 apollo 17 exploration missions apollo program probes landing conspiracy theories colonization tourism time telling lunar calendar lunisolar calendar month lunar month nodal period fortnight sennight lunar mansion phases names new full names crescent super micro blood blue black dark wet tetrad related topics psychology lunar effect moon illusion pareidolia man in the moon moon rabbit craters named after people memorials on the moon moon in fiction moon in mythology hj ki and bil moon is made of green cheese natural satellite double planet lilith hypothetical second moon category moon portal earth sciences portal solar system portal this article related to the moon is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title sodium tail of the moon oldid 826052854 categories lunar sciencesodiummoon stubshidden categories all stub articles
