new moon and in which month a second new moon occurs depends on the time zone for example the new moon of 2016-10-01t00 11 utc occurs on 1 october for europe asia and oceania making it the first of

almanac definition of a blue moon as the third full moon in a season with four full moons a season lasts about three months and usually has three new moons this event occurs about every 33 months

powerful and effective others do not believe any rituals or workings should be conducted at these times the term black moon is not formally established in astronomy and is used at best in the popularization of astronomy there is no single definition of the term black moon the new moon itself cannot be observed the lack of a new or full moon in february can only be assigned to the month not to any particular date as such this is also not observable the event of a black moon is an artefact of how the gregorian calendar or the seasons map onto lunations there is no physical or geometric
