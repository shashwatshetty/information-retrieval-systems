from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search solar prominence with images of jupiter and earth for size comparison a prominence is a large bright gaseous feature extending outward from the sun s surface often in a loop shape prominences are anchored to the sun s surface in the photosphere and extend outwards into the sun s corona while the corona consists of extremely hot ionized gases known as plasma which do not emit much visible light prominences contain much cooler plasma similar in composition to that of the chromosphere the prominence plasma is typically a hundred times more lit and denser than the coronal plasma a prominence forms over timescales of about a day and may persist in the corona for several weeks or months looping hundreds of thousands of miles into space some prominences break apart and may then give rise to coronal mass ejections scientists are currently researching how and why prominences are formed the red glowing looped material is plasma a hot gas composed of electrically charged hydrogen and helium the prominence plasma flows along a tangled and twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the sun s internal dynamo an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward releasing the plasma a typical prominence extends over many thousands of kilometers the largest on record was estimated at over 800,000 kilometres 500,000 mi long roughly the radius of the sun contents the first detailed description of a solar prominence was in 14th century laurentian codex describing the solar eclipse of 1 may 1185 they were described as flame like tongues of live embers when a prominence is viewed from a different perspective so that it is against the sun instead of against space it appears darker than the surrounding background this formation is instead called a solar filament it is possible for a projection to be both a filament and a prominence some prominences are so powerful that they throw out matter from the sun into space at speeds ranging from 600 km s to more than 1000 km s other prominences form huge loops or arching columns of glowing gases over sunspots that can reach heights of hundreds of thousands of kilometers prominences may last for a few days or even for a few months solar prominence video clip an eclipse followed by an unusually large dark prominence on september 23 2012 the sun emitted a large blast of plasma in the form of a prominence on september 16 2012 the sun had a beautiful prominence that slowly twisted and dissipated over several hours on the final day of 2012 the sun presented a beautiful twisting prominence that rose high into the corona for about 3 hours on september 30 2014 multiple nasa observatories watched a filament rise but instead of erupting from the sun the filament collapsed solar prominences detached solar prominence a limb s flare and after flare prominence major eruptive prominence skylab 1973 solar prominence stereo behind solar prominence stereo ahead solar prominences in red visible around the edge of the sun during a solar eclipse wikimedia commons has media related to prominence coronal mass ejection solar flare corona galsgaard k longbottom a w 1999 formation of solar prominences by flux convergence astrophysical journal 510 444 bibcode 1999apj .510 .444g doi 10.1086 306559 low b c fong b fan y 2003 the mass of a solar quiescent prominence astrophysical journal 594 2 1060 bibcode 2003apj .594.1060l doi 10.1086 377042 golub l pasachoff j m 1997 the solar corona cambridge university press isbn 0-521-48535-5 tandberg hanssen einar 1995 the nature of solar prominences dordrecht kluwer acad isbn 978-0792333746 v t e the sun internal structure core radiation zone tachocline convection zone atmosphere photosphere supergranulation granule faculae sunspot chromosphere plage spicule moreton wave corona transition region coronal hole coronal loop coronal mass ejection prominence helmet streamer supra arcade downflows variation solar cycle list of solar cycles solar maximum solar minimum wolf number solar wind flare helioseismology heliosphere current sheet termination shock heliosheath heliopause bow shock related topics heliophysics solar activity solar astronomy solar dynamo eclipse solar energy solar neutrino solar observation solar phenomena solar physics solar system solar telescope solar time space weather standard solar model radiation spectral class g2v retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title solar prominence oldid 811900402 categories solar phenomenahidden categories articles containing video clips
