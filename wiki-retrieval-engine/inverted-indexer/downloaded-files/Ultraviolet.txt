radiation is also produced by electric arcs arc welders must wear eye protection and cover their skin to prevent photokeratitis and serious sunburn ultraviolet uv is an electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength from 10 nm to 400 nm shorter than that of visible light but longer than x rays uv radiation is present in sunlight constituting about 10 of the total light output of the sun it is also produced by electric arcs and specialized lights such as mercury vapor lamps tanning lamps and black lights although long wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms it can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce consequently the chemical and biological effects of uv are greater than simple heating effects and many practical applications of uv radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules suntan and sunburn are familiar effects of over exposure of the skin to uv along with higher risk of skin cancer living things on dry land would be severely damaged by ultraviolet radiation from the sun if most of it were not filtered out by the earth s atmosphere more energetic shorter wavelength extreme uv below 121 nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground ultraviolet is also responsible for the formation of bone strengthening vitamin d in most land vertebrates including humans the uv spectrum thus has effects both beneficial and harmful to human health ultraviolet rays are invisible to most humans although insects birds and some mammals can see near uv contents ultraviolet rays are invisible to most humans the lens in a human eye ordinarily filters out uvb frequencies or higher and humans lack color receptor adaptations for ultraviolet rays under some conditions children and young adults can see ultraviolet down to wavelengths of about 310 nm and people with aphakia missing lens or replacement lens can also see some uv wavelengths near uv radiation is visible to insects some mammals and birds small birds have a fourth color receptor for ultraviolet rays this gives birds true uv vision ultraviolet means beyond violet from latin ultra beyond violet being the color of the highest frequencies of visible light ultraviolet has a higher frequency than violet light uv radiation was discovered in 1801 when the german physicist johann wilhelm ritter observed that invisible rays just beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum darkened silver chloride soaked paper more quickly than violet light itself he called them oxidizing rays to emphasize chemical reactivity and to distinguish them from heat rays discovered the previous year at the other end of the visible spectrum the simpler term chemical rays was adopted shortly thereafter and it remained popular throughout the 19th century although there were those who held that these were an entirely different sort of radiation from light notably john william draper who named them tithonic rays the terms chemical rays and heat rays were eventually dropped in favor of ultraviolet and infrared radiation respectively in 1878 the sterilizing effect of short wavelength light by killing bacteria was discovered by 1903 it was known the most effective wavelengths were around 250 nm in 1960 the effect of ultraviolet radiation on dna was established the discovery of the ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths below 200 nm named vacuum ultraviolet because it is strongly absorbed by the air was made in 1893 by the german physicist victor schumann the electromagnetic spectrum of ultraviolet radiation uvr defined most broadly as 10 400 nanometers can be subdivided into a number of ranges recommended by the iso standard iso-21348 name abbreviation

though 150 200 nm wavelengths can propagate through nitrogen extreme ultraviolet euv 10 121 10.25 124 1.642 19.867 entirely ionizing radiation by some definitions completely absorbed by the atmosphere a variety of solid state and vacuum devices have been explored for use in different parts of the uv spectrum many approaches seek to adapt visible light sensing devices but these can suffer from unwanted response to visible light and various instabilities ultraviolet can be detected by suitable photodiodes and photocathodes which can be tailored to be sensitive to different parts of the uv spectrum sensitive ultraviolet photomultipliers are available spectrometers and radiometers are made for measurement of uv radiation silicon detectors are used across the spectrum people cannot perceive uv directly since the lens of the human eye blocks most radiation in the wavelength range of 300 400 nm shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea nevertheless the photoreceptors of the retina are sensitive to near uv and people lacking a lens a condition known as aphakia perceive near uv as whitish blue or whitish violet vacuum uv or vuv wavelengths shorter than 200 nm are strongly absorbed by molecular oxygen in the air though the longer wavelengths of about 150 200 nm can propagate through nitrogen scientific instruments can therefore utilize this spectral range by operating in an oxygen free atmosphere commonly pure nitrogen without the need for costly vacuum chambers significant examples include 193 nm photolithography equipment for semiconductor manufacturing and circular dichroism spectrometers technology for vuv instrumentation was largely driven by solar astronomy for many decades while optics can be used to remove unwanted visible light that contaminates the vuv in general detectors can be limited by their response to non vuv radiation and the development of solar blind devices has been an important area of research wide gap solid state devices or vacuum devices with high cutoff photocathodes can be attractive compared to silicon diodes extreme uv euv or sometimes xuv is characterized by a transition in the physics of interaction with matter wavelengths longer than about 30 nm interact mainly with the outer valence electrons of atoms while wavelengths shorter than that interact mainly with inner shell electrons and nuclei the long end of the euv spectrum is set by a prominent he spectral line at 30.4 nm euv is strongly absorbed by most known materials but it is possible to synthesize multilayer optics that reflect up to about 50 percent of euv radiation at normal incidence this technology was pioneered by the nixt and mssta sounding rockets in the 1990s and it has been used to make telescopes for solar imaging see also the extreme ultraviolet explorer euve satellite levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation in essence all uvc is blocked by diatomic oxygen 100 200 nm or by ozone triatomic oxygen 200 280 nm in the atmosphere the ozone layer then blocks most uvb meanwhile uva is hardly affected by ozone and most of it reaches the ground uva makes up almost all of the circa 25 percent of the sun s total uv light that penetrates the earth s atmosphere very hot objects emit uv radiation see black body radiation the sun emits ultraviolet radiation at all wavelengths including the extreme ultraviolet where it crosses into x rays at 10 nm extremely hot stars emit proportionally more uv radiation than the sun sunlight in space at the top of earth s atmosphere see solar constant is composed of about 50 infrared light 40 visible light and 10 ultraviolet light for a total intensity of about 1400 w m2 in vacuum however at ground level sunlight is 44 visible light 3 ultraviolet with the sun at its zenith and the remainder infrared thus the atmosphere blocks about 77 of the sun s uv almost entirely in the shorter uv wavelengths when the sun is highest in the sky zenith of the ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth s surface more than 95 is the longer wavelengths of uva with the small remainder uvb there is essentially no uvc the fraction of uvb which remains in uv radiation after passing through the atmosphere is heavily dependent on cloud cover and atmospheric conditions thick clouds block uvb effectively but in partly cloudy days patches of blue sky showing between clouds are also sources of scattered uva and uvb which are produced by rayleigh scattering in the same way as the visible blue light from those parts of the sky uv b also plays a major role in plant development as it affects most of the plant hormones the shorter bands of uvc as well as even more energetic uv radiation produced by the sun are absorbed by oxygen and generate the ozone in the ozone layer when single oxygen atoms produced by uv photolysis of dioxygen react with more dioxygen the ozone layer is especially important in blocking most uvb and the remaining part of uvc not already blocked by ordinary oxygen in air ultraviolet absorbers are molecules used in organic materials polymers paints etc to absorb uv radiation to reduce the uv degradation photo oxidation of a material the absorbers can themselves degrade over time so monitoring of absorber levels in weathered materials is necessary in sunscreen ingredients that absorb uva uvb rays such as avobenzone oxybenzone and octyl methoxycinnamate are organic chemical absorbers or blockers they are contrasted with inorganic absorbers blockers of uv radiation such as carbon black titanium dioxide and zinc oxide for clothing the ultraviolet protection factor upf represents the ratio of sunburn causing uv without and with the protection of the fabric similar to spf sun protection factor ratings for sunscreen standard summer fabrics have upf of approximately 6 which means that about 20 of uv will pass through suspended nanoparticles in stained glass prevent uv rays from causing chemical reactions that change image colors a set of stained glass color reference chips is planned to be used to calibrate the color cameras for the 2019 esa mars rover mission since they will remain unfaded by the high level of uv present at the surface of mars common soda lime glass is partially transparent to uva but is opaque to shorter wavelengths whereas fused quartz glass depending on quality can be transparent even to vacuum uv wavelengths ordinary window glass passes about 90 of the light above 350 nm but blocks over 90 of the light below 300 nm wood s glass is a nickel bearing form of glass with a deep blue purple color that blocks most visible light and passes ultraviolet two black light fluorescent tubes showing use the longer tube is a f15t8 blb 18 inch 15 watt tube shown in the bottom image in a standard plug in fluorescent fixture the shorter is an f8t5 blb 12 inch 8 watt tube used in a portable battery powered black light sold as a pet urine detector main article blacklight a black light lamp emits long wave uva radiation and little visible light fluorescent black light lamps work similarly to other fluorescent lamps but use a phosphor on the inner tube surface which emits uva radiation instead of visible light some lamps use a deep bluish purple wood s glass optical filter that blocks almost all visible light with wavelengths longer than 400 nanometres others use plain glass instead of the more expensive wood s glass so they appear light blue to the eye when operating a black light may also be formed very inefficiently by using a layer of wood s glass in the envelope for an incandescent bulb though cheaper than fluorescent uv lamps only 0.1 of the input power is emitted as usable ultraviolet radiation mercury vapor black lights in ratings up to 1 kw with uv emitting phosphor and an envelope of wood s glass are used for theatrical and concert displays black lights are used in applications in which extraneous visible light must be minimized mainly to observe fluorescence the colored glow that many substances give off when exposed to uv light uva uvb emitting bulbs are also sold for other special purposes such as tanning lamps and reptile keeping 9 watt germicidal uv lamp in compact fluorescent cf form factor commercial germicidal lamp in butcher shop shortwave uv lamps are made using a lamp tube with no phosphor coating composed of fused quartz since ordinary glass absorbs uvc these lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the uvc band at 253.7 nm and 185 nm due to the mercury within the lamp as well as some visible light from 85 to 90 of the uv produced by these lamps is at 253.7 nm whereas only 5 10 is at 185 nm the fused quartz glass tube passes the 253 nm radiation but blocks the 185 nm wavelength such tubes have two or three times the uvc power of a regular fluorescent lamp tube these low pressure lamps have a typical efficiency of approximately 30 40 meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp they will produce approximately 30 40 watts of total uv output these germicidal lamps are used extensively for disinfection of surfaces in laboratories and food processing industries and for disinfecting water supplies halogen lamps with fused quartz envelopes are used as inexpensive uv light sources in the near uv range from 400 to 300 nm in some scientific instruments main article gas discharge lamp specialized uv gas discharge lamps containing different gases produce uv radiation at particular spectral lines for scientific purposes argon and deuterium arc lamps are often used as stable sources either windowless or with various windows such as magnesium fluoride these are often the emitting sources in uv spectroscopy equipment for chemical analysis other uv sources with more continuous emission spectra include xenon arc lamps commonly used as sunlight simulators deuterium arc lamps mercury xenon arc lamps and metal halide arc lamps the excimer lamp a uv source developed within the last two decades is seeing increasing use in scientific fields it has the advantages of high intensity high efficiency and operation at a variety of wavelength bands into the vacuum ultraviolet a 380 nanometre uv led makes some common household items fluoresce light emitting diodes leds can be manufactured to emit radiation in the ultraviolet range led efficiency at 365 nm is about 5 8 whereas efficiency at 395 nm is closer to 20 and power outputs at these longer uv wavelengths are also better such led arrays are beginning to be used for uv curing applications and are already successful in digital print applications and inert uv curing environments power densities approaching 3 w cm2 30 kw m2 are now possible and this coupled with recent developments by photoinitiator and resin formulators makes the expansion of led cured uv materials likely uvc leds are beginning to be used in disinfection and as line sources to replace deuterium lamps in liquid chromatography instruments main article excimer laser gas lasers laser diodes and solid state lasers can be manufactured to emit ultraviolet rays and lasers are available which cover the entire uv range the nitrogen gas laser uses electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules to emit a beam that is mostly uv the strongest ultraviolet lines are at 337.1 nm and 357.6.6 nm wavelength another type of high power gas laser is the excimer laser they are widely used lasers emitting in ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet wavelength ranges presently uv argon fluoride arf excimer lasers operating at 193 nm are routinely used in integrated circuit production by photolithography the current wavelength limit of production of coherent uv is about 126 nm characteristic of the ar2 excimer laser direct uv emitting laser diodes are available at 375 nm uv diode lasers have been demonstrated using ce lisaf crystals cerium doped lithium strontium aluminum fluoride a process developed in the 1990s at lawrence livermore national laboratory wavelengths shorter than 325 nm are commercially generated in diode pumped solid state lasers ultraviolet lasers can also be made by applying frequency conversion to lower frequency lasers ultraviolet lasers have applications in industry laser engraving medicine dermatology and keratectomy chemistry maldi free air secure communications computing optical storage and manufacture of integrated circuits the vacuum ultraviolet vuv band 100 200 nm can be generated by non linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers the generation is generally done in gasses e g krypton hydrogen which are two photon resonant near 193 nm or metal vapors e g magnesium by making one of the lasers tunable the vuv can be tuned if one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the vuv production is intensified however resonances also generate wavelength dispersion and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing difference frequency mixing lambda1 lambda2 lambda3 has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning in particular difference frequency mixing two photons of an arf 193 nm excimer laser with a tunable visible or near ir laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable vuv covering from 100 nm to 200 nm practically the lack of suitable gas vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110 nm tunable vuv wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window free configurations lasers have been used to indirectly generate non coherent extreme uv euv radiation at 13.5 nm for extreme ultraviolet lithography the euv is not emitted by the laser but rather by electron transitions in an extremely hot tin or xenon plasma which is excited by an excimer laser this technique does not require a synchrotron yet can produce uv at the edge of the x ray spectrum synchrotron light sources can also produce all wavelengths of uv including those at the boundary of the uv and x ray spectra at 10 nm further information health effects of sun exposure the impact of ultraviolet radiation on human health has implications for the risks and benefits of sun exposure and is also implicated in issues such as fluorescent lamps and health getting too much sun exposure can be harmful but in moderation is beneficial uv light causes the body to produce vitamin d which is essential for life the human body needs some uv radiation in order for one to maintain adequate vitamin d levels however the harmful effects typically outweigh the benefits exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a source of vitamin d one minimal erythemal dose of sunlight uv radiation provides the equivalent of about 20,000 iu of vitamin d2 taken as an oral supplement if an adult s arms and legs are exposed to a half minimal erythemal uv radiation it is the same as taking 3,000 iu of vitamin d3 through an oral supplement this exposure of 10 15 minutes on a frequency of two to three times per week will cause the adult s skin to produce enough vitamin d it is not necessary to expose the face to the uv as facial skin provides little vitamin d3 individuals whose metabolism makes taking oral vitamin d ineffective are able through exposure to an ultraviolet lamp that emits uv b radiation to achieve a 25 oh d blood level three benefits of uv exposure are production of vitamin d improvement in mood and increased energy uvb induces production of vitamin d in the skin at rates of up to 1,000 ius per minute this vitamin helps to regulate calcium metabolism vital for the nervous system and bone health immunity cell proliferation insulin secretion and blood pressure in third world countries foods fortified with vitamin d are practically nonexistent most people in the world depend on the sun to get vitamin d there are not many foods that naturally have vitamin d examples are cod liver oil and oily fish if people cannot get sunlight then they will need 1,000 iu of vitamin d per day to stay healthy a person would have to eat oily fish three or four times per week in order to get enough vitamin d from that food source alone people with higher levels of vitamin d tend to have lower rates of diabetes heart disease and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure however it has been found that vitamin d supplementation does not improve cardiovascular health or metabolism so the link with vitamin d must be in part indirect people who get more sun are generally healthier and also have higher vitamin d levels it has been found that ultraviolet radiation even uva produces nitric oxide no in the skin and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease although long term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal it has been found in a danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study and were much less likely to have a heart attack than those who did not have these cancers people in certain situations such as people with intellectual disabilities and neurodevelopmental disorders who stay inside most of the time have low vitamin d levels getting enough vitamin d can help stave off autoimmune diseases cardiovascular disease many types of cancer dementia types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus and respiratory tract infections fetuses and children who do not get enough vitamin d can suffer from growth retardation and skeletal deformities uv rays also treat certain skin conditions modern phototherapy has been used to successfully treat psoriasis eczema jaundice vitiligo atopic dermatitis and localized scleroderma in addition uv light in particular uvb radiation has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes the most common type of skin cell as such sunlight therapy can be a candidate for treatment of conditions such as psoriasis and exfoliative cheilitis conditions in which skin cells divide more rapidly than usual or necessary worldwide one billion people suffer from hypertension in the u s half of the 146 million hypertensive patients don t have their blood pressure under control in hypertension patients who suffer from vitamin d deficiency uvb radiation but not uva lowered blood pressure modern pharmaceutical therapy has resulted in an overall reduction in hypertension particularly in countries with high gdp per capita a review of blood pressure statistics before these pharmaceuticals were available shows a coherent correlation between high blood pressure and higher latitude seasons of the year also impact high blood pressure bp is lower in the summer months in high latitudes than it is in the winter when there is less sunlight individuals with more sun exposure synthesize more active vitamin d 1,25 di hydroxy cholecalciferol from diet or ultraviolet radiation exposure a combination of lower ultraviolet radiation with insufficient vitamin d in a diet leads to vitamin d deficiency individuals whose vitamin d ranks in the lowest quartile have double the all cause mortality of those who rank in the highest quartile they are also more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease hypertension and organ cancer medical trials have demonstrated that vitamin d supplements do not prevent or treat hypertension or cardiovascular disease although they can help in skeletal metabolism epidemiological and observational studies show indications that exposure to ultraviolet radiation particularly sunlight might reduce all cause mortality and can help reduce cardiovascular disease and hypertension one hundred years of scientific data has demonstrated that the effect of ultraviolet radiation on human skin is carcinogenic there is a lack of evidence that this carcinogenic effect like risks such as smoking or alcohol is responsible for higher mortality there are significant archives of studies demonstrating that ultraviolet radiation from sunlight provides measurable health benefits independent of vitamin d vitamin d promotes the creation of serotonin the production of serotonin is in direct proportion to the degree of bright sunlight the body receives conversely serotonin levels decrease when sunlight is at its lowest levels as in autumn and winter changes in serotonin levels affect how humans act relative to mood and behavior measured serotonin is much higher among those who die in summer rather than winter serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter that is thought to provide sensations of happiness well being and serenity to human beings it is thought that serotonin affects a wide range of human bodily functions from anxiety and mood to bowel function to bone density to sexuality its importance in human activity continues to be a source of much scientific examination and experimentation the amount of the brown pigment melanin in the skin increases after exposure to uv radiation at moderate levels depending on skin type this is commonly known as a sun tan melanin is an excellent photoprotectant that absorbs both uvb and uva radiation and dissipates the energy as harmless heat protecting the skin against both direct and indirect dna damage there is no doubt that a little sunlight is good for you but 5 to 15 minutes of casual sun exposure of hands face and arms two to three times a week during the summer months is sufficient to keep your vitamin d levels high world health organization main article ultraviolet light and cancer in humans excessive exposure to uv radiation can result in acute and chronic harmful effects on the eye s dioptric system and retina the risk is elevated at high altitudes and people living in high latitude countries where snow covers the ground right into early summer and sun positions even at zenith are low are particularly at risk skin the circadian and immune systems can also be affected ultraviolet photons harm the dna molecules of living organisms in different ways in one common damage event adjacent thymine bases bond with each other instead of across the ladder this thymine dimer makes a bulge and the distorted dna molecule does not function properly sunburn effect as measured by the uv index is the product of the sunlight spectrum radiation intensity and the erythemal action spectrum skin sensitivity across the range of uv wavelengths sunburn production per milliwatt is increased by almost a factor of 100 between the near uvb wavelengths of 315 295 nm the differential effects of various wavelengths of light on the human cornea and skin are sometimes called the erythemal action spectrum the action spectrum shows that uva does not cause immediate reaction but rather uv begins to cause photokeratitis and skin redness with caucasians more sensitive at wavelengths starting near the beginning of the uvb band at 315 nm and rapidly increasing to 300 nm the skin and eyes are most sensitive to damage by uv at 265 275 nm which is in the lower uvc band at still shorter wavelengths of uv damage continues to happen but the overt effects are not as great with so little penetrating the atmosphere the who standard ultraviolet index is a widely publicized measurement of total strength of uv wavelengths that cause sunburn on human skin by weighting uv exposure for action spectrum effects at a given time and location this standard shows that most sunburn happens due to uv at wavelengths near the boundary of the uva and uvb bands bioolympics discover uv reaction index to detect the leak of uv light overexposure to uvb radiation not only can cause sunburn but also some forms of skin cancer however the degree of redness and eye irritation which are largely not caused by uva do not predict the long term effects of uv although they do mirror the direct damage of dna by ultraviolet all bands of uv radiation damage collagen fibers and accelerate aging of the skin both uva and uvb destroy vitamin a in skin which may cause further damage uvb radiation can cause direct dna damage this cancer connection is one reason for concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole the most deadly form of skin cancer malignant melanoma is mostly caused by dna damage independent from uva radiation this can be seen from the absence of a direct uv signature mutation in 92 of all melanoma occasional overexposure and sunburn are probably greater risk factors for melanoma than long term moderate exposure uvc is the highest energy most dangerous type of ultraviolet radiation and causes adverse effects that can variously be mutagenic or carcinogenic in the past uva was considered not harmful or less harmful than uvb but today it is known to contribute to skin cancer via indirect dna damage free radicals such as reactive oxygen species uva can generate highly reactive chemical intermediates such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals which in turn can damage dna the dna damage caused indirectly to skin by uva consists mostly of single strand breaks in dna while the damage caused by uvb includes direct formation of thymine dimers or other pyrimidine dimers and double strand dna breakage uva is immunosuppressive for the entire body accounting for a large part of the immunosuppressive effects of sunlight exposure and is mutagenic for basal cell keratinocytes in skin uvb photons can cause direct dna damage uvb radiation excites dna molecules in skin cells causing aberrant covalent bonds to form between adjacent pyrimidine bases producing a dimer most uv induced pyrimidine dimers in dna are removed by the process known as nucleotide excision repair that employs about 30 different proteins those pyrimidine dimers that escape this repair process can induce a form of programmed cell death apoptosis or can cause dna replication errors leading to mutation as a defense against uv radiation the amount of the brown pigment melanin in the skin increases when exposed to moderate depending on skin type levels of radiation this is commonly known as a sun tan the purpose of melanin is to absorb uv radiation and dissipate the energy as harmless heat blocking the uv from damaging skin tissue uva gives a quick tan that lasts for days by oxidizing melanin that was already present and triggers the release of the melanin from melanocytes uvb yields a tan that takes roughly 2 days to develop because it stimulates the body to produce more melanin sunscreen prevents the direct dna damage which causes sunburn most of these products contain an spf rating to show how well they block uvb rays the spf rating however offers no data about uva protection some sunscreen lotions now include compounds such as titanium dioxide which helps protect against uva rays other uva blocking compounds found in sunscreen include zinc oxide and avobenzone main article sunscreen demonstration of the effect of sunscreen the man s face has sunscreen on his right only the left image is a regular photograph of the face the right image is taken by reflected uv light the side of the face with sunscreen is darker because the sunscreen absorbs the uv light medical organizations recommend that patients protect themselves from uv radiation by using sunscreen five sunscreen ingredients have been shown to protect mice against skin tumors however some sunscreen chemicals produce potentially harmful substances if they are illuminated while in contact with living cells the amount of sunscreen that penetrates into the lower layers of the skin may be large enough to cause damage sunscreen reduces the direct dna damage that causes sunburn by blocking uvb and the usual spf rating indicates how effectively this radiation is blocked spf is therefore also called uvb pf for uvb protection factor this rating however offers no data about important protection against uva which does not primarily cause sunburn but is still harmful since it causes indirect dna damage and is also considered carcinogenic several studies suggest that the absence of uva filters may be the cause of the higher incidence of melanoma found in sunscreen users compared to non users the photochemical properties of melanin make it an excellent photoprotectant however sunscreen chemicals cannot dissipate the energy of the excited state as efficiently as melanin and therefore if sunscreen ingredients penetrate into the lower layers of the skin the amount of reactive oxygen species may be increased the amount of sunscreen that penetrates through the stratum corneum may or may not be large enough to cause damage in an experiment by hanson et al that was published in 2006 the amount of harmful reactive oxygen species ros was measured in untreated and in sunscreen treated skin in the first 20 minutes the film of sunscreen had a protective effect and the number of ros species was smaller after 60 minutes however the amount of absorbed sunscreen was so high that the amount of ros was higher in the sunscreen treated skin than in the untreated skin the study indicates that sunscreen must be reapplied within 2 hours in order to prevent uv light from penetrating to sunscreen infused live skin cells ultraviolet radiation can aggravate several skin conditions and diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus sj gren s syndrome sinear usher syndrome rosacea dermatomyositis darier s disease kindler weary syndrome signs are often used to warn of the hazard of strong uv sources the eye is most sensitive to damage by uv in the lower uvc band at 265 275 nm radiation of this wavelength is almost absent from sunlight but is found in welder s arc lights and other artificial sources exposure to these can cause welder s flash or arc eye photokeratitis and can lead to cataracts pterygium and pinguecula formation to a lesser extent uvb in sunlight from 310 280 nm also causes photokeratitis snow blindness and the cornea the lens and the retina can be damaged protective eyewear is beneficial to those exposed to ultraviolet radiation since light can reach the eyes from the sides full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure as in high altitude mountaineering mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of uv radiation both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice ordinary untreated eyeglasses give some protection most plastic lenses give more protection than glass lenses because as noted above glass is transparent to uva and the common acrylic plastic used for lenses is less so some plastic lens materials such as polycarbonate inherently block most uv main article uv degradation uv damaged polypropylene rope left and new rope right uv degradation is one form of polymer degradation that affects plastics exposed to sunlight the problem appears as discoloration or fading cracking loss of strength or disintegration the effects of attack increase with exposure time and sunlight intensity the addition of uv absorbers inhibits the effect sensitive polymers include thermoplastics and speciality fibers like aramids uv absorption leads to chain degradation and loss of strength at sensitive points in the chain structure aramid rope must be shielded with a sheath of thermoplastic if it is to retain its strength ir spectrum showing carbonyl absorption due to uv degradation of polyethylene many pigments and dyes absorb uv and change colour so paintings and textiles may need extra protection both from sunlight and fluorescent bulbs two common sources of uv radiation window glass absorbs some harmful uv but valuable artifacts need extra shielding many museums place black curtains over watercolour paintings and ancient textiles for example since watercolours can have very low pigment levels they need extra protection from uv various forms of picture framing glass including acrylics plexiglass laminates and coatings offer different degrees of uv and visible light protection because of its ability to cause chemical reactions and excite fluorescence in materials ultraviolet radiation has a number of applications the following table gives some uses of specific wavelength bands in the uv spectrum 13.5 nm extreme ultraviolet lithography 30 200 nm photoionization ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy standard integrated circuit manufacture by photolithography 230 365 nm uv id label tracking barcodes 230 400 nm optical sensors various instrumentation 240 280 nm disinfection decontamination of surfaces and water dna absorption has a peak at 260 nm 200 400 nm forensic analysis drug detection 270 360 nm protein analysis dna sequencing drug discovery 280 400 nm medical imaging of cells 300 320 nm light therapy in medicine 300 365 nm curing of polymers and printer inks 350 370 nm bug zappers flies are most attracted to light at 365 nm main article ultraviolet photography a portrait taken using only uv light between the wavelengths of 335 and 365 nanometers photographic film responds to ultraviolet radiation but the glass lenses of cameras usually block radiation shorter than 350 nm slightly yellow uv blocking filters are often used for outdoor photography to prevent unwanted bluing and overexposure by uv rays for photography in the near uv special filters may be used photography with wavelengths shorter than 350 nm requires special quartz lenses which do not absorb the radiation digital cameras sensors may have internal filters that block uv to improve color rendition accuracy sometimes these internal filters can be removed or they may be absent and an external visible light filter prepares the camera for near uv photography a few cameras are designed for use in the uv photography by reflected ultraviolet radiation is useful for medical scientific and forensic investigations in applications as widespread as detecting bruising of skin alterations of documents or restoration work on paintings photography of the fluorescence produced by ultraviolet illumination uses visible wavelengths of light aurora at jupiter s north pole as seen in ultraviolet light by the hubble space telescope in ultraviolet astronomy measurements are used to discern the chemical composition of the interstellar medium and the temperature and composition of stars because the ozone layer blocks many uv frequencies from reaching telescopes on the surface of the earth most uv observations are made from space corona discharge on electrical apparatus can be detected by its ultraviolet emissions corona causes degradation of electrical insulation and emission of ozone and nitrogen oxide eproms erasable programmable read only memory are erased by exposure to uv radiation these modules have a transparent quartz window on the top of the chip that allows the uv radiation in colorless fluorescent dyes that emit blue light under uv are added as optical brighteners to paper and fabrics the blue light emitted by these agents counteracts yellow tints that may be present and causes the colors and whites to appear whiter or more brightly colored uv fluorescent dyes that glow in the primary colors are used in paints papers and textiles either to enhance color under daylight illumination or to provide special effects when lit with uv lamps blacklight paints that contain dyes that glow under uv are used in a number of art and esthetic applications a bird appears on many visa credit cards when they are held under a uv light source to help prevent counterfeiting of currency or forgery of important documents such as driver s licenses and passports the paper may include a uv watermark or fluorescent multicolor fibers that are visible under ultraviolet light postage stamps are tagged with a phosphor that glows under uv rays to permit automatic detection of the stamp and facing of the letter uv fluorescent dyes are used in many applications for example biochemistry and forensics some brands of pepper spray will leave an invisible chemical uv dye that is not easily washed off on a pepper sprayed attacker which would help police identify the attacker later in some types of nondestructive testing uv stimulates fluorescent dyes to highlight defects in a broad range of materials these dyes may be carried into surface breaking defects by capillary action liquid penetrant inspection or they may be bound to ferrite particles caught in magnetic leakage fields in ferrous materials magnetic particle inspection uv is an investigative tool at the crime scene helpful in locating and identifying bodily fluids such as semen blood and saliva for example ejaculated fluids or saliva can be detected by high power uv sources irrespective of the structure or colour of the surface the fluid is deposited upon uv vis microspectroscopy is also used to analyze trace evidence such as textile fibers and paint chips as well as questioned documents other applications include the authentication of various collectibles and art and detecting counterfeit currency even materials not specially marked with uv sensitive dyes may have distinctive fluorescence under uv exposure or may fluoresce differently under short wave versus long wave ultraviolet using multi spectral imaging it is possible to read illegible papyrus such as the burned papyri of the villa of the papyri or of oxyrhynchus or the archimedes palimpsest the technique involves taking pictures of the illegible document using different filters in the infrared or ultraviolet range finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light thus the optimum spectral portion can be found for distinguishing ink from paper on the papyrus surface simple nuv sources can be used to highlight faded iron based ink on vellum after a training exercise involving fake body fluids a healthcare worker s personal protective equipment is checked with ultraviolet light to find invisible drops of fluids these fluids could contain deadly viruses or other contamination ultraviolet aids in the detection of organic material deposits that remain on surfaces where periodic cleaning and sanitizing may not have been properly accomplished it is used in the hotel industry manufacturing and other industries where levels of cleanliness or contamination are inspected perennial news feature for many television news organizations involves an investigative reporter s using a similar device to reveal unsanitary conditions in hotels public toilets hand rails and such uv vis spectroscopy is widely used as a technique in chemistry to analyze chemical structure the most notable one being conjugated systems uv radiation is often used to excite a given sample where the fluorescent emission is measured with a spectrofluorometer in biological research uv radiation is used for quantification of nucleic acids or proteins a collection of mineral samples brilliantly fluorescing at various wavelengths as seen while being irradiated by uv light ultraviolet lamps are also used in analyzing minerals and gems in pollution control applications ultraviolet analyzers are used to detect emissions of nitrogen oxides sulfur compounds mercury and ammonia for example in the flue gas of fossil fired power plants ultraviolet radiation can detect thin sheens of spilled oil on water either by the high reflectivity of oil films at uv wavelengths fluorescence of compounds in oil or by absorbing of uv created by raman scattering in water see also flame detector in general ultraviolet detectors use either a solid state device such as one based on silicon carbide or aluminium nitride or a gas filled tube as the sensing element uv detectors that are sensitive to uv in any part of the spectrum respond to irradiation by sunlight and artificial light a burning hydrogen flame for instance radiates strongly in the 185 to 260 nanometer range and only very weakly in the ir region whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the uv band yet very strongly at ir wavelengths thus a fire detector that operates using both uv and ir detectors is more reliable than one with a uv detector alone virtually all fires emit some radiation in the uvc band whereas the sun s radiation at this band is absorbed by the earth s atmosphere the result is that the uv detector is solar blind meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the sun so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors uv detectors are sensitive to most fires including hydrocarbons metals sulfur hydrogen hydrazine and ammonia arc welding electrical arcs lightning x rays used in nondestructive metal testing equipment though this is highly unlikely and radioactive materials can produce levels that will activate a uv detection system the presence of uv absorbing gases and vapors will attenuate the uv radiation from a fire adversely affecting the ability of the detector to detect flames likewise the presence of an oil mist in the air or an oil film on the detector window will have the same effect ultraviolet radiation is used for very fine resolution photolithography a procedure wherein a chemical called a photoresist is exposed to uv radiation that has passed through a mask the exposure causes chemical reactions to occur in the photoresist after removal of unwanted photoresist a pattern determined by the mask remains on the sample steps may then be taken to etch away deposit on or otherwise modify areas of the sample where no photoresist remains photolithography is used in the manufacture of semiconductors integrated circuit components and printed circuit boards photolithography processes used to fabricate electronic integrated circuits presently use 193 nm uv and are experimentally using 13.5 nm uv for extreme ultraviolet lithography electronic components that require clear transparency for light to exit or enter photovoltaic panels and sensors can be potted using acrylic resins that are cured using uv energy the advantages are low voc emissions and rapid curing effects of uv on finished surfaces in 0 20 and 43 hours certain inks coatings and adhesives are formulated with photoinitiators and resins when exposed to uv light polymerization occurs and so the adhesives harden or cure usually within a few seconds applications include glass and plastic bonding optical fiber coatings the coating of flooring uv coating and paper finishes in offset printing dental fillings and decorative fingernail gels uv sources for uv curing applications include uv lamps uv leds and excimer flash lamps fast processes such as flexo or offset printing require high intensity light focused via reflectors onto a moving substrate and medium so high pressure hg mercury or fe iron doped based bulbs are used energized with electric arcs or microwaves lower power fluorescent lamps and leds can be used for static applications small high pressure lamps can have light focused and transmitted to the work area via liquid filled or fiber optic light guides the impact of uv on polymers is used for modification of the roughness and hydrophobicity of polymer surfaces for example a poly methyl methacrylate surface can be smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet uv radiation is useful in preparing low surface energy polymers for adhesives polymers exposed to uv will oxidize thus raising the surface energy of the polymer once the surface energy of the polymer has been raised the bond between the adhesive and the polymer is stronger using a catalytic chemical reaction from titanium dioxide and uvc exposure oxidation of organic matter converts pathogens pollens and mold spores into harmless inert byproducts the cleansing mechanism of uv is a photochemical process contaminants in the indoor environment are almost entirely organic carbon based compounds which break down when exposed to high intensity uv at 240 to 280 nm short wave ultraviolet radiation can destroy dna in living microorganisms uvc s effectiveness is directly related to intensity and exposure time uv has also been shown to reduce gaseous contaminants such as carbon monoxide and vocs uv lamps radiating at 184 and 254 nm can remove low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide if the air is recycled between the room and the lamp chamber this arrangement prevents the introduction of ozone into the treated air likewise air may be treated by passing by a single uv source operating at 184 nm and passed over iron pentaoxide to remove the ozone produced by the uv lamp main article ultraviolet germicidal irradiation a low pressure mercury vapor discharge tube floods the inside of a hood with shortwave uv light when not in use sterilizing microbiological contaminants from irradiated surfaces ultraviolet lamps are used to sterilize workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities commercially available low pressure mercury vapor lamps emit about 86 of their radiation at 254 nanometers nm with 265 nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve uv at these germicidal wavelengths damage a microorganism s dna so that it cannot reproduce making it harmless even though the organism may not be killed since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet rays in small cracks and other shaded areas these lamps are used only as a supplement to other sterilization techniques uv c leds are relatively new to the commercial market and are gaining in popularity due to their monochromatic nature 5 nm these leds can target a specific wavelength needed for disinfection this is especially important knowing that pathogens vary in their sensitivity to specific uv wavelengths leds are mercury free instant on off and have unlimited cycling throughout the day disinfection using uv radiation is commonly used in wastewater treatment applications and is finding an increased usage in municipal drinking water treatment many bottlers of spring water use uv disinfection equipment to sterilize their water solar water disinfection has been researched for cheaply treating contaminated water using natural sunlight the uv a irradiation and increased water temperature kill organisms in the water ultraviolet radiation is used in several food processes to kill unwanted microorganisms uv can be used to pasteurize fruit juices by flowing the juice over a high intensity ultraviolet source the effectiveness of such a process depends on the uv absorbance of the juice pulsed light pl is a technique of killing microorganisms on surfaces using pulses of an intense broad spectrum rich in uv c between 200 and 280 nm pulsed light works with xenon flash lamps that can produce flashes several times per second disinfection robots use pulsed uv some animals including birds reptiles and insects such as bees can see near ultraviolet wavelengths many fruits flowers and seeds stand out more strongly from the background in ultraviolet wavelengths as compared to human color vision scorpions glow or take on a yellow to green color under uv illumination thus assisting in the control of these arachnids many birds have patterns in their plumage that are invisible at usual wavelengths but observable in ultraviolet and the urine and other secretions of some animals including dogs cats and human beings are much easier to spot with ultraviolet urine trails of rodents can be detected by pest control technicians for proper treatment of infested dwellings butterflies use ultraviolet as a communication system for sex recognition and mating behavior for example in the colias eurytheme butterfly males rely on visual cues to locate and identify females instead of using chemical stimuli to find mates males are attracted to the ultraviolet reflecting color of female hind wings in pieris napi butterflies it was shown that females in northern finland with less uv radiation present in the environment possessed stronger uv signals to attract their males than those occurring further south this suggested that it was evolutionarily more difficult to increase the uv sensitivity of the eyes of the males than to increae the uv signals emitted by the females many insects use the ultraviolet wavelength emissions from celestial objects as references for flight navigation a local ultraviolet emitter will normally disrupt the navigation process and will eventually attract the flying insect entomologist using a uv light for collecting beetles in chaco paraguay the green fluorescent protein gfp is often used in genetics as a marker many substances such as proteins have significant light absorption bands in the ultraviolet that are of interest in biochemistry and related fields uv capable spectrophotometers are common in such laboratories ultraviolet traps called bug zappers are used to eliminate various small flying insects they are attracted to the uv and are killed using an electric shock or trapped once they come into contact with the device different designs of ultraviolet radiation traps are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects during faunistic survey studies main article ultraviolet light therapy ultraviolet radiation is helpful in the treatment of skin conditions such as psoriasis and vitiligo exposure to uva while the skin is hyper photosensitive by taking psoralens is an effective treatment for psoriasis due to the potential of psoralens to cause damage to the liver puva therapy may be used only a limited number of times over a patient s lifetime uvb phototherapy does not require additional medications or topical preparations for the therapeutic benefit only the exposure is needed however phototherapy can be effective when used in conjunction with certain topical treatments such as anthralin coal tar and vitamin a and d derivatives or systemic treatments such as methotrexate and soriatane reptiles need uvb for biosynthesis of vitamin d and other metabolic processes specifically cholecalciferol vitamin d3 which is needed to for basic cellular neural functioning as well as the utilization calcium for bone and egg production the uva wavelength is also visible to many reptiles and might play a signifiant role in their ability survive in the wild as well as visual communication between individuals therefore in a typical reptile enclosure a fluorescent uv a b source at the proper strength spectrum for the species must be available for many captive species to survive simple supplementation with cholecalciferol vitamin d3 will not be enough as there s a complete biosynthetic pathway that is leapfrogged risks of possible overdoses the intermediate molecules and metabolites also place important functions in the animals health natural sunlight in the right levels is always going to be superior to artificial sources but this might be possible for keepers in different parts of the world it is a known problem that high levels of output of the uva part of the spectrum can both cause cellular and dna damage to sensitive parts of their bodies especially the eyes were blindness is the result from an improper uva b source use and placement photokeratitis for many keepers there must also be a provision for an adequate heat source this has resulted in the marketing of heat and light combination products keepers should be careful of these combination light heat and uva b generators they typically emit high levels of uva with lower levels of uvb that are set and difficult to control so that animals can have their needs met a better strategy is to use individual sources of these elements and so they can be placed and controlled by the keepers for the max benefit of the animals the evolution of early reproductive proteins and enzymes is attributed in modern models of evolutionary theory to ultraviolet radiation uvb causes thymine base pairs next to each other in genetic sequences to bond together into thymine dimers a disruption in the strand that reproductive enzymes cannot copy this leads to frameshifting during genetic replication and protein synthesis usually killing the cell before formation of the uv blocking ozone layer when early prokaryotes approached the surface of the ocean they almost invariably died out the few that survived had developed enzymes that monitored the genetic material and removed thymine dimers by nucleotide excision repair enzymes many enzymes and proteins involved in modern mitosis and meiosis are similar to repair enzymes and are believed to be evolved modifications of the enzymes originally used to overcome dna damages caused by uv high energy visible light ultraviolet catastrophe uv stabilizers in plastics weather testing of polymers ultraviolet germicidal
