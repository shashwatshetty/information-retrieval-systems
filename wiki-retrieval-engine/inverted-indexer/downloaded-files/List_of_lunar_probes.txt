from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search it has been suggested that this article be merged into list of missions to the moon discuss proposed since october 2016 surveyor 3 on the moon the first image returned by luna 3 showed the far side of the moon this is a list of space probes that have flown by impacted or landed on the moon for the purpose of lunar exploration as well as probes launched toward the moon that failed to reach their target confirmed future probes are included but missions that are still at the concept stage or which never progressed beyond the concept stage are not the list does not include the manned apollo missions contents colour key mission or flyby completed successfully or partially successfully failed or cancelled mission mission en route or in progress including mission extensions planned mission means tentatively identified as classified by nasa 1 these are cold war era soviet missions mostly failures about which few or no details have been officially released the information given may be speculative date is the date of closest encounter flybys impact impactors orbital insertion to end of mission whether planned or premature orbiters landing to end of mission whether planned or premature landers launch missions that never got underway due to failure at or soon after launch in cases which do not fit any of the above the event to which the date refers is stated note that as a result of this scheme missions are not always listed in order of launch in the case of flybys such as gravity assists that are incidental to the main mission success indicates the successful completion of the flyby not necessarily that of the main mission spacecraft organization date type status notes image ref pioneer 0 dod 17 august 1958
