main settlements lydia assyrian luddu greek lyd a turkish was an iron age kingdom of western asia minor located generally east of ancient ionia in the modern western turkish provinces of u ak manisa and inland zmir its population spoke an anatolian language known as lydian its capital was sardis the kingdom of lydia existed from about 1200 bce to 546 bce at its greatest extent during the 7th century bce it covered all of western anatolia in 546 bce it became a province of the achaemenid persian empire known as the satrapy of lydia or sparda in old persian in 133 bce it became part of the roman province of asia coins are said to have been invented in lydia around the 7th century bce contents the endonym fard the name the lydians called themselves survives in bilingual and trilingual stone carved notices of the achaemenid empire the satrapy of sparda old persian aramaic saparda babylonian sapardu elamitic i barda hebrew these in the greek tradition are associated with sardis the capital city of king gyges constructed during the 7th century bce the region of the lydian kingdom was during the 15th-14th centuries part of the arzawa kingdom however the lydian language is not usually categorized as part of the luwic subgroup as are the other nearby anatolian languages luwian carian and lycian an etruscan lydian association has long been a subject of conjecture the greek historian herodotus stated that the etruscans came from lydia repeated in virgil s epic poem the aeneid and etruscan like language was found on the lemnos stele from the aegean sea island of lemnos however the decipherment of lydian and its classification as an anatolian language mean that etruscan and lydian were not even part of the same language family nevertheless a recent genetic study of likely etruscan descendants in tuscany found strong similarities with individuals in western anatolia indicating that etruscans may have lived in or near the region at one time the boundaries of historical lydia varied across the centuries it was bounded first by mysia caria phrygia and coastal ionia later the military power of alyattes ii and croesus expanded lydia which with its capital at sardis controlled all asia minor west of the river halys except lycia after the persian conquest the river maeander was regarded as its southern boundary and during imperial roman times lydia comprised the country between mysia and caria on the one side and phrygia and the aegean sea on the other the lydian language was an indo european language in the anatolian language family related to luwian and hittite due to its fragmentary attestation the meanings of many words are unknown but much of the grammar has been determined similar to other anatolian languages it featured extensive use of prefixes and grammatical particles to chain clauses together lydian had also undergone extensive syncope leading to numerous consonant clusters atypical of indo european languages lydian finally became extinct during the 1st century bce lydia developed after the decline of the hittite empire in the 12th century bce in hittite times the name for the region had been arzawa according to greek source the original name of the lydian kingdom was maionia or maeonia homer iliad ii 865 v 43 xi 431 refers to the inhabitants of lydia as maiones homer describes their capital not as sardis but as hyde iliad xx 385 hyde may have been the name of the district in which sardis was located later herodotus histories i 7 adds that the meiones were renamed lydians after their king lydus son of atys during the mythical epoch that preceded the heracleid dynasty this etiological eponym served to account for the greek ethnic name lydoi the hebrew term for lydians l m as found in the book of jeremiah 46.9 has been similarly considered beginning with flavius josephus to be derived from lud son of shem however hippolytus of rome 234 ce offered an alternative opinion that the lydians were descended from ludim son of mizraim during biblical times the lydian warriors were famous archers some maeones still existed during historical times in the upland interior along the river hermus where a town named maeonia existed according to pliny the elder natural history book v 30 and hierocles author of synecdemus lydian mythology is virtually unknown and their literature and rituals lost due to the absence of any monuments or archaeological finds with extensive inscriptions therefore myths involving lydia are mainly from greek mythology for the greeks tantalus was a primordial ruler of mythic lydia and niobe his proud daughter her husband amphion associated lydia with thebes in greece and through pelops the line of tantalus was part of the founding myths of mycenae s second dynasty in reference to the myth of bellerophon karl kerenyi remarked in the heroes of the greeks 1959 p 83 as lykia was thus connected with crete and as the person of pelops the hero of olympia connected lydia with the peloponnesos so bellerophontes connected another asian country or rather two lykia and karia with the kingdom of argos in greek myth lydia had also adopted the double axe symbol that also appears in the mycenaean civilization the labrys omphale daughter of the river iardanos was a ruler of lydia whom heracles was required to serve for a time his adventures in lydia are the adventures of a greek hero in a peripheral and foreign land during his stay heracles enslaved the itones killed syleus who forced passers by to hoe his vineyard slew the serpent of the river sangarios which appears in the heavens as the constellation ophiucus and captured the simian tricksters the cercopes accounts tell of at least one son born to omphale and heracles diodorus siculus 4.31.8 and ovid heroides 9.54 mention a son lamos while pseudo apollodorus bibliotheke 2.7.8 gives the name agelaus and pausanias 2.21.3 names tyrsenus son of heracles by the lydian woman all three heroic ancestors indicate a lydian dynasty claiming heracles as their ancestor herodotus 1.7 refers to a heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled lydia yet were perhaps not descended from omphale he also mentions 1.94 the recurring legend that the etruscan civilization was founded by colonists from lydia led by tyrrhenus brother of lydus however dionysius of halicarnassus was skeptical of this story indicating that the etruscan language and customs were known to be totally dissimilar to those of the lydians later chronographers also ignored herodotus s statement that agron was the first to be a king and included alcaeus belus and ninus in their list of kings of lydia strabo 5.2.2 makes atys father of lydus and tyrrhenus to be a descendant of heracles and omphale all other accounts name atys lydus and tyrrhenus as being among the pre heraclid kings of lydia the gold deposits in the river pactolus that were the source of the proverbial wealth of croesus lydia s last king were said to have been left there when the legendary king midas of phrygia washed away the midas touch in its waters in euripides tragedy the bacchae dionysus while he is maintaining his human disguise declares his country to be lydia early 6th century bce lydian electrum coin one third stater denomination according to herodotus the lydians were the first people to use gold and silver coins and the first to establish retail shops in permanent locations it is not known however whether herodotus meant that the lydians were the first to use coins of pure gold and pure silver or the first precious metal coins in general despite this ambiguity this statement of herodotus is one of the pieces of evidence most often cited on behalf of the argument that lydians invented coinage at least in the west even though the first coins were neither gold nor silver but an alloy of the two called electrum the dating of these first stamped coins is one of the most frequently debated topics of ancient numismatics with dates ranging from 700 bce to 550 bce but the most common opinion is that they were minted at or near the beginning of the reign of king alyattes sometimes referred to incorrectly as alyattes ii who ruled lydia c 610-550 bce the first coins were made of electrum an alloy of gold and silver that occurs naturally but that was further debased by the lydians with added silver and copper the largest of these coins are commonly referred to as a 1 3 stater trite denomination weighing around 4.7 grams though no full staters of this type have ever been found and the 1 3 stater probably should be referred to more correctly as a stater after a type of a transversely held scale the weights used in such a scale from ancient greek to stand which also means standard these coins were stamped with a lion s head adorned with what is likely a sunburst which was the king s symbol the most prolific mint for early electrum coins was sardis which produced large quantities of the lion head thirds sixths and twelfths along with lion paw fractions to complement the largest denomination fractions were made including a hekte sixth hemihekte twelfth and so forth down to a 96th with the 1 96 stater weighing only about 0.15 grams there is disagreement however over whether the fractions below the twelfth are actually lydian it took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade even the smallest denomination electrum coins perhaps worth about a day s subsistence would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread ionia uncertain city 600-550 bce hemiobol horse head rough incuse the first coins to be used for retailing on a large scale basis were likely small silver fractions hemiobol ancient greek coinage minted by the ionian greeks in the late sixth century bce alyattes son was croesus who became associated with great wealth sardis was renowned as a beautiful city around 550 bce near the beginning of his reign croesus paid for the construction of the temple of artemis at ephesus which became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world croesus was defeated in battle by cyrus ii of persia in 546 bce with the lydian kingdom losing its autonomy and becoming a persian satrapy main article list of kings of lydia map of the lydian empire in its final period of sovereignty under croesus c 547 bce 7th century bce boundary in red lydia was ruled by three dynasties atyads 1300 bce or earlier heraclids tylonids to 687 bce according to herodotuse the heraclids ruled for 22 generations during the period from 1185 bce lasting for 505 years alyattes was the king of lydia in 776 bce the last king of this dynasty was myrsilos or candaules candaules after ruling for seventeen years he was assassinated by his former friend gyges who succeeded him on the throne of lydia mermnads gyges called gugu of luddu in assyrian inscriptions 687-652 bce or 690-657 bce once established on the throne gyges devoted himself to consolidating his kingdom and making it a military power the capital was relocated from hyde to sardis barbarian cimmerians sacked many lydian cities except for sardis gyges was the son of dascylus who when recalled from banishment in cappadocia by the lydian king myrsilos called candaules the dog strangler a title of the lydian hermes by the greeks sent his son back to lydia instead of himself gyges turned to egypt sending his faithful carian troops along with ionian mercenaries to assist psammetichus in ending assyrian domination some bible scholars believe that gyges of lydia was the biblical character gog ruler of magog who is mentioned in the book of ezekiel and the book of revelation ardys ii 652-621 bce sadyattes 621-609 bce or 624-610 bce herodotus wrote in his inquiries that he fought with cyaxares the descendant of deioces and with the medes drove out the cimmerians from asia captured smyrna which had been founded by colonists from colophon and invaded the city states clazomenae and miletus alyattes ii 609 or 619-560 bce one of the greatest kings of lydia when cyaxares attacked lydia the kings of cilicia and babylon intervened and negotiated a peace in 585 bce whereby the river halys was established as the medes frontier with lydia herodotus writes on the refusal of alyattes to give up his supplicants when cyaxares sent to demand them of him war broke out between the lydians and the medes and continued for five years with various success in the course of it the medes gained many victories over the lydians and the lydians also gained many victories over the medes the battle of the eclipse was the final battle in a five year war between alyattes ii of lydia and cyaxares of the medes it took place on may 28 585 bce and ended abruptly due to a total solar eclipse croesus 560-546

the nearby exarchate of ephesus under the tetrarchy reform of emperor diocletian in 296 ce lydia was revived as the name of a separate roman province much smaller than the former satrapy with its capital at sardis together with the provinces of caria hellespontus lycia pamphylia phrygia prima and phrygia secunda pisidia all in modern turkey and the insulae ionian islands mostly in modern
