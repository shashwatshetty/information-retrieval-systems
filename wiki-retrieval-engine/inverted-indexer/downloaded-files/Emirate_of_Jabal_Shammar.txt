from the mid nineteenth century to 1921 jabal shammar in english is translated as the mountain of the shammar jabal shammar s capital was ha il it was led by a monarchy of the house of rash d it included parts of modern day saudi arabia iraq and jordan contents the emirate of jabal shammar was established in 1836 and spent most of its existence in a feud with the house of saud over control of nejd the rash dis rulers of jabal shammar had succeeded in ousting the saudis from riyadh in 1891 following the battle of mulayda this resulted in the abolition of the second saudi state the emirate of nejd and incorporation of its territory into jabal shammar as the saudis were out of the picture exiled in kuwait the house of rash d sought friendly ties with the ottoman empire to its north this alliance became less and less profitable during the course of the 19th century as the ottomans lost influence and legitimacy in 1902 abdulaziz ibn saud succeeded in recapturing riyadh for the house of saud and began a campaign to reconquer the region a campaign which turned out to be highly successful for the saudis after several clashes the rash dis and saudis engaged into a full scale war over the region of qassim which resulted in a painful defeat for the rash dis and the death of the rash di emir abdul aziz ibn mitaab al rash d a photograph of abdul aziz bin mut ib nicknamed al jan zah

would remain in abdullah s line al l bin abdullah 1848 68 the son of abdullah talal is remembered for his relative liberalism and interest in building projects during his rule the barzan palace in ha il was completed he established regular trade connections with iraq and expanded the rash di sphere of influence the inhabitants of kaseem weary of wahhabee tyranny turned their eyes towards telal who had already given a generous and inviolable asylum to the numerous political exiles of that district secret negotiations took place and at a favourable moment the entire uplands of that province after a fashion not indeed peculiar to arabia annexed themselves to the kingdom of shommer by universal and unanimous suffrage william gifford palgrave 1865 129 talal was considered relatively tolerant towards foreigners including traders in ha il many of these traders belonged to the shia sect hated by some sunni doubly hated by the wahabees but telal sic affected not to perceive their religious discrepansies and silenced all murmurs by marks of special favour towards these very dissenters and also by the advantages which their presence was not long in procuring for the town william gifford
