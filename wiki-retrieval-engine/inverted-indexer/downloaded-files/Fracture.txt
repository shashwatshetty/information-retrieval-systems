fracture hydrogen embrittlement impact mechanical overload stress corrosion cracking thermal shock wear yielding a fracture is the separation of an object or material into two or more pieces under the action of stress the fracture of a solid usually occurs due to the development of certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within the solid if a displacement develops perpendicular to the surface of displacement it is called a normal tensile crack or simply a crack if a displacement develops tangentially to the surface of displacement it is called a shear crack slip band or dislocation brittle fractures occur with no apparent deformation before fracture ductile fractures occur when visible deformation does occur before separation fracture strength or breaking strength is the stress when a specimen fails or fractures a detailed understanding of how fracture occurs in materials may be assisted by the study of fracture mechanics contents stress vs strain curve typical of aluminum 1 ultimate tensile strength 2 yield strength 3 proportional limit stress 4 fracture 5 offset strain typically 0.2 fracture strength also known as breaking strength is the stress at which a specimen fails via fracture this is usually determined for a given specimen by a tensile test which charts the stress strain curve see image the final recorded point is the fracture strength ductile materials have a fracture strength lower than the ultimate tensile strength uts whereas in brittle materials the fracture strength is equivalent to the uts if a ductile material reaches its ultimate tensile strength in a load controlled situation it will continue to deform with no additional load application until it ruptures however if the loading is displacement controlled the deformation of the material may relieve the load preventing rupture brittle fracture in glass fracture of an aluminum crank arm of a bicycle where bright brittle fracture dark fatigue fracture in brittle fracture no apparent plastic deformation takes place before fracture brittle fracture typically involves little energy absorption and occurs at high speeds up to 7000 ft sec in steel in most cases brittle fracture will continue even when loading is discontinued in brittle crystalline materials fracture can occur by cleavage as the result of tensile stress acting normal to crystallographic planes with low bonding cleavage planes in amorphous solids by contrast the lack of a crystalline structure results in a conchoidal fracture with cracks proceeding normal to the applied tension the theoretical strength of a crystalline material is roughly where is the young s modulus of the material is the surface energy and is the equilibrium distance between atomic centers on the other hand a crack introduces a stress concentration modeled by for sharp cracks where is the loading stress is half the length of the crack and is the radius of curvature at the crack tip putting these two equations together we get looking closely we can see that sharp cracks small and large defects large both lower the fracture strength of the material recently scientists have discovered supersonic fracture the phenomenon of crack propagation faster than the speed of sound in a material this phenomenon was recently also verified by experiment of fracture in rubber like materials the basic sequence in a typical brittle fracture is introduction of a flaw either before or after the material is put in service slow and stable crack propagation under recurring loading and sudden rapid failure when the crack reaches critical crack length based on the conditions defined by fracture mechanics brittle fracture may be avoided by controlling three primary factors material fracture toughness kc nominal stress level and introduced flaw size a residual stresses temperature loading rate and stress concentrations also contribute to brittle fracture by influencing the three primary factors under certain conditions ductile materials can exhibit brittle behavior rapid loading low temperature and triaxial stress constraint conditions may cause ductile materials to fail without prior deformation ductile failure of a specimen strained axially in ductile fracture extensive plastic deformation necking takes place before fracture the terms rupture or ductile rupture describe the ultimate failure of ductile materials loaded in tension rather than cracking the material pulls apart generally leaving a rough surface in this case there is slow propagation and an absorption of a large amount energy before fracture schematic representation of the steps in ductile fracture in pure tension many ductile metals especially materials with high purity can sustain very large deformation of 50 100 or more strain before fracture under favorable loading condition and environmental condition the strain at which the fracture happens is controlled by the purity of the materials at room temperature pure iron can undergo deformation up to 100 strain before breaking while cast iron or high carbon steels can barely sustain 3 of strain because ductile rupture involves a high degree of plastic deformation the fracture behavior of a propagating crack as modelled above changes fundamentally some of the energy from stress concentrations at the crack tips is dissipated by plastic deformation ahead of the crack as it propagates the basic steps in ductile fracture are void formation void coalescence also known as crack formation crack propagation and failure often resulting in a cup and cone shaped failure surface main article fracture mechanics there are three standard conventions for defining relative displacements in elastic materials in order to analyze crack propagation as proposed by irwin in addition fracture can involve uniform strain or a combination of these modes fracture crack separation modes mode i crack opening mode a tensile stress normal to the plane of the crack mode ii crack sliding mode a shear stress acting parallel to the plane of the crack and perpendicular to the crack front mode iii crack tearing mode a shear stress acting parallel to the plane of the crack and parallel to the crack front the manner in which a crack propagates through a material gives insight into the mode of fracture with ductile fracture a crack moves slowly and is accompanied by a large amount of plastic deformation around the crack tip a ductile crack will usually not propagate unless an increased stress is applied and generally cease propagating when loading is removed in a ductile material a crack may progress to a section of the material where stresses are slightly lower and stop due to the blunting effect of plastic deformations at the crack tip on the other hand with brittle fracture cracks spread very rapidly with little or no plastic deformation the cracks that propagate in a brittle material will continue to grow once initiated crack propagation is also categorized by the crack characteristics at the microscopic level a crack that passes through the grains within the material is undergoing transgranular fracture a crack that propagates along the grain boundaries is termed an intergranular fracture typically the bonds between material grains are stronger at room temperature than the material itself so transgranular fracture is more likely to occur when temperatures increase enough to weaken the grain bonds intergranular fracture is the more common fracture mode failures caused by brittle fracture have not been limited to any particular category of engineered structure though brittle fracture is less common than other types of failure the impacts to life and property can be more severe the following notable historic failures were attributed to
