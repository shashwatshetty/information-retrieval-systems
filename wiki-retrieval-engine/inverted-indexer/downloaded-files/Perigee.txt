from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search it has been suggested that perihelion and aphelion be merged into this article discuss proposed since january 2018 several terms redirect here for other uses see apogee disambiguation and perigee disambiguation not to be confused with apse or aspis the apsides indicate the nearest and farthest points of an orbiting body around its host 1 farthest 3 focus 2 nearest apocenter primary pericenter aphelion sun perihelion apastron star periastron apogee earth perigee example of periapsis and apoapsis with two large bodies in elliptic orbits around their center of mass an apsis greek plural apsides greek is an extreme point in an object s orbit the word comes via latin from greek and is cognate with apse for elliptic orbits about a larger body there are two apsides named with the prefixes peri from peri meaning near and ap or apo from ap meaning away from added to a reference to the thing being orbited for a body orbiting the sun the point of least distance is the perihelion and the point of greatest distance is the aphelion the terms become periastron and apastron when discussing orbits around other stars for any satellite of earth including the moon the point of least distance is the perigee and greatest distance the apogee for objects in lunar orbit the point of least distance is the pericynthion and the greatest distance the apocynthion perilune and apolune are also used for any orbit around a center of mass there are the terms periapsis and apoapsis or apapsis pericenter and apocenter are equivalent alternatives a straight line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis is the line of apsides this is the major axis of the ellipse its greatest diameter for a two body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line at one of the two foci of the ellipse when one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus however whether or not this is the case both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the system s center of mass with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses historically in geocentric systems apsides were measured from the center of the earth however in the case of the moon the center of mass of the earth moon system or earth moon barycenter as the common focus of both the moon s and earth s orbits about each other is about 75 of the way from earth s center to its surface in orbital mechanics the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the centers of mass of the central and orbiting body however in the case of spacecraft the family of terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital altitude of the spacecraft from the surface of the central body assuming a constant standard reference radius contents keplerian orbital elements point f is at the pericenter point h is at the apocenter and the red line between them is the line of apsides these formulae characterize the pericenter and apocenter of an orbit pericenter maximum speed at minimum pericenter distance apocenter minimum speed at maximum apocenter distance while in accordance with kepler s laws of planetary motion based on the conservation of angular momentum and the conservation of energy these two quantities are constant for a given orbit specific relative angular momentum specific orbital energy where a is the semi major axis equal to is the standard gravitational parameter e is the eccentricity defined as note that for conversion from heights above the surface to distances between an orbit and its primary the radius of the central body has to be added and conversely the arithmetic mean of the two limiting distances is the length of the semi major axis a the geometric mean of the two distances is the length of the semi minor axis b the geometric mean of the two limiting speeds is which is the speed of a body in a circular orbit whose radius is the words pericenter and apocenter are often seen although periapsis apoapsis are preferred in technical usage various related terms are used for other celestial objects the gee helion astron and galacticon forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the earth sun stars and the galactic center respectively the suffix jove is occasionally used for jupiter while saturnium has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for saturn the gee form is commonly used as a generic closest approach to planet term instead of specifically applying to the earth during the apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion referencing cynthia an alternative name for the greek moon goddess artemis were used when referring to the moon regarding black holes the term peri apomelasma from a greek root was used by physicist geoffrey a landis in 1998 before peri aponigricon from latin appeared in the scientific literature in 2002 as well as peri apobothron from greek bothros meaning hole or pit the following suffixes are added to peri and apo to form the terms for the nearest and farthest orbital distances from these objects solar system

message for the orbit of the earth around the sun the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations the variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the sun which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic the earth s eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system see milankovitch cycles on a very long time scale the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons and they make one complete cycle in 22,000 to 26,000 years there is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from earth that is called the apsidal precession this is closely related to the precession of the axis currently the earth reaches perihelion in early january approximately 14 days after the december solstice at perihelion the earth s center is about astronomical units au or 147,098,070 km 91,402,500 mi from the sun s center the earth reaches aphelion currently in early july approximately 14 days after the june solstice the aphelion distance between the earth s and sun s centers is currently about or 152,097,700 km 94,509,100 mi in the short term the dates of perihelion and aphelion can vary up to 2 days from one year to another this significant variation is due to the presence of the moon while the earth moon barycenter is moving on a stable orbit around the sun the position of the earth s center which is on average about 4,700 kilometres 2,900 mi from the barycenter could be shifted in any direction from it and this affects the timing of the actual closest approach between the sun s and the earth s centers which in turn defines the timing of perihelion in a given year astronomers commonly express the timing of perihelion relative to the vernal equinox not in terms of days and hours but rather as an angle of orbital displacement the so called longitude of the periapsis also called longitude of the pericenter for the orbit of the earth this is called the longitude of perihelion and in 2000 it was about 282.895 by the year 2010 this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283.067 the dates and times
