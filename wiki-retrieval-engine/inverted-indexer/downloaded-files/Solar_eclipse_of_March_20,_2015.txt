was also observed by meteorological satellite meteosat-10 this section needs to be updated may 2017 the european union has a solar power output of about 90 gigawatts and production could have been temporarily decreased by up to 34 gw of that dependent on the clarity of the sky in actuality the dip was less than expected with a 13 gw drop in germany happening due to overcast skies this was the first time that an eclipse had a significant impact on the power system and the electricity sector took measures to mitigate the impact the power gradient change in power may be 400 mw minute and 700 mw minute places in netherlands belgium and denmark may be 80 obscured temperature may decrease by 3 c and wind power may decrease as winds are reduced by 0.7 m s in addition to the eclipse 20 march 2015 was also the day of the march equinox also known as the spring or vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere in addition six supermoons were expected for 2015 the supermoon on 20 march 2015 was the third of the year however it was a new moon near side facing away from the sun and only its shadow was visible see also blood moon prophecy proponents of the blood moon prophecy such as bob o dell also pointed out that 20 march 2015 was also a significant day on the jewish and biblical calendar that evening was the onset of the hebrew month of nisan the first month in the biblical calendar year furthermore the path of the total eclipse over the north pole was a highly symbolic location infusing the day with both great natural significance and profound religious meaning according to o dell due to the significance of the eclipse a global prayer event in jerusalem was organized that day the event was visible as a partial eclipse all across europe including norway sweden denmark the united
