disambiguation rock outcrop at the shores of lake baikal russia in the foregroung a beach made of pebble sized rocks can be seen rock or stone is a natural substance a solid aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids for example granite a common rock is a combination of the minerals quartz feldspar and biotite the earth s outer solid layer the lithosphere is made of rock rock has been used by humankind throughout history the minerals and metals in rocks have been essential to human civilization three major groups of rocks are defined igneous sedimentary and metamorphic the scientific study of rocks is called petrology which is an essential component of geology contents see also formation of rocks rock outcrop along a mountain creek near oros costa rica rocks are composed of grains of minerals which are homogeneous solids formed from a chemical compound arranged in an orderly manner the aggregate minerals forming the rock are held together by chemical bonds the types and abundance of minerals in a rock are determined by the manner in which it was formed many rocks contain silica sio2 a compound of silicon and oxygen that forms 74.3 of the earth s crust this material forms crystals with other compounds in the rock the proportion of silica in rocks and minerals is a major factor in determining their name and properties rocks are classified according to characteristics such as mineral and chemical composition permeability texture of the constituent particles and particle size these physical properties are the result of the processes that formed the rocks over the course of time rocks can transform from one type into another as described by a geological model called the rock cycle this transformation produces three general classes of rock igneous sedimentary and metamorphic those three classes are subdivided into many groups there are however no hard and fast boundaries between allied rocks by increase or decrease in the proportions of their minerals they pass through gradations from one to the other the distinctive structures of one kind of rock may thus be traced gradually merging into those of another hence the definitions adopted in rock names simply correspond to selected points in a continuously graduated series main article igneous rock sample of igneous gabbro igneous rock derived from the latin word igneus meaning of fire from ignis meaning fire is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava this magma may be derived from partial melts of pre existing rocks in either a planet s mantle or crust typically the melting of rocks is caused by one or more of three processes an increase in temperature a decrease in pressure or a change in composition igneous rocks are divided into two main categories plutonic or intrusive rocks result when magma cools and crystallizes slowly within the earth s crust a common example of this type is granite volcanic or extrusive rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as lava or fragmental ejecta forming minerals such as pumice or basalt the chemical abundance and the rate of cooling of magma typically forms a sequence known as bowen s reaction series most major igneous rocks are found along this scale about 64.7 of the earth s crust by volume consists of igneous rocks making it the most plentiful category of these 66 are basalts and gabbros 16 are granite and 17 granodiorites and diorites only 0.6 are syenites and 0.3 peridotites and dunites the oceanic crust is 99 basalt which is an igneous rock of mafic composition granites and similar rocks known as meta granitoids form much of the continental crust over 700 types of igneous rocks have been described most of them having formed beneath the surface of earth s crust these have diverse properties depending on their composition and the temperature and pressure conditions in which they were formed main article sedimentary rock sedimentary sandstone with iron oxide bands sedimentary rocks are formed at the earth s surface by the accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier rocks minerals and organisms or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water sedimentation this process causes clastic sediments pieces of rock or organic particles detritus to settle and accumulate or for minerals to chemically precipitate evaporite from a solution the particulate matter then undergoes compaction and cementation at moderate temperatures and pressures diagenesis before being deposited sediments are formed by weathering of earlier rocks by erosion in a source area and then transported to the place of deposition by water wind ice mass movement or glaciers agents of denudation mud rocks comprise 65 mudstone shale and siltstone sandstones 20 to 25 and carbonate rocks 10 to 15 limestone and dolostone about 7.9 of the crust by volume is composed of sedimentary rocks with 82 of those being shales while the remainder consists of limestone 6 sandstone and arkoses 12 sedimentary rocks often contain fossils sedimentary rocks form under the influence of gravity and typically are deposited in horizontal or near horizontal layers or strata and may be referred to as stratified rocks a small fraction of sedimentary rocks deposited on steep slopes will show cross bedding where one layer stops abruptly along an interface where another layer eroded the first as it was laid atop the first main article metamorphic rock metamorphic banded gneiss metamorphic rocks are formed by subjecting any rock type sedimentary rock igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock to different temperature and pressure conditions than those in which the original rock was formed this process is called metamorphism meaning to change in form the result is a profound change in physical properties and chemistry of the stone the original rock known as the protolith transforms into other mineral types or other forms of the same minerals by recrystallization the temperatures and pressures required for this process are always higher than those found at the earth s surface temperatures greater than 150 to 200 c and pressures of 1500 bars metamorphic rocks compose 27.4 of the crust by volume the three major classes of metamorphic rock are based upon the formation mechanism an intrusion of magma that heats the surrounding rock causes contact metamorphism a temperature dominated transformation pressure metamorphism occurs when sediments are buried deep under the ground pressure is dominant and temperature plays a smaller role this is termed burial metamorphism and it can result in rocks such as jade where both heat and pressure play a role the mechanism is termed regional metamorphism this is typically found in mountain building regions depending on the structure metamorphic rocks are divided into two general categories those that possess a texture are referred to as foliated the remainders are termed non foliated the name of the rock is then determined based on the types of minerals present schists are foliated rocks that are primarily composed of lamellar minerals such as micas a gneiss has visible bands of differing lightness with a common example being the granite gneiss other varieties of foliated rock include slates phyllites and mylonite familiar examples of non foliated metamorphic rocks include marble soapstone and serpentine this branch contains quartzite a metamorphosed form of sandstone and hornfels ceremonial cairn of rocks an ovoo from mongolia mi vida uranium mine near moab utah the use of rocks has had a huge impact on the cultural and technological development of the human race rocks have been used by humans and other hominids for at least 2.5 million years lithic technology marks some of the oldest and continuously used technologies the mining of rocks for their metal ore content has been one of the most important factors of human advancement which has progressed at different rates in different places in part because of the kind of metals available from the rocks of a region main article mining bay of fires tasmania mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth from an ore body vein or coal seam this term also includes the removal of soil materials recovered by mining include base metals precious metals iron uranium coal diamonds limestone oil shale rock salt and potash mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes or created artificially in a laboratory or factory mining in a wider sense comprises extraction of any resource e g petroleum natural gas salt or even water from the earth mining of rock and metals has been done since prehistoric times modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine extraction of the desired materials and finally reclamation of the land to prepare it for other uses once mining ceases the nature of mining processes creates a potential negative impact on the environment both during the mining operations and for years after the mine has closed this impact has led to most of the world s nations adopting regulations to manage negative effects of mining operations geology history of earth geologic time scale geomorphology human timeline life timeline list of rock
