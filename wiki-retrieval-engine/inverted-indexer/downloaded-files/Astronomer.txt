from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the astronomer by johannes vermeer an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of earth they look at stars planets moons comets and galaxies as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies there are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the universe as a whole astronomers usually fit into two types observational and theoretical observational astronomers make direct observations of planets stars and galaxies and analyze the data in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers have to observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial bodies work there are further subcategories inside these two main branches of astronomy such as planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology contents for subdisciplines see outline of astronomy galileo is often referred to as the father of modern astronomy historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a ph d in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately 7,000 members this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy the international astronomical union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the ph d level and beyond guy consolmagno vatican observatory analyzing a meteorite 2014 contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a charge coupled device ccd camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable in college university most astronomers get a ph d in astronomy or physics emily lakdawalla at the planetary conference 2013 while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescopes and instruments
