the slow transition from a predominantly christian and greek speaking anatolia to a predominantly muslim and turkish speaking one was underway the mevlevi order of dervishes which was established in konya during the 13th century by sufi poet celaleddin rumi played a significant role in the islamization of the diverse people of anatolia who had previously been hellenized thus alongside the

despite the increasingly prominent european presence the ottoman empire s trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century the ottoman empire s power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries particularly during the reign of suleiman the magnificent who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society education taxation and criminal

the tanzimat reforms of the 19th century which had been instituted by mahmud ii were aimed to modernise the ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in western europe the efforts of midhat pasha during the late tanzimat era led the ottoman constitutional movement of 1876 which introduced the first constitutional era but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire as the empire gradually shrank in size military power and wealth especially after the ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875 which led to uprisings in the balkan provinces that culminated into the russo turkish war of 1877 78 many balkan muslims migrated to the empire s heartland in anatolia along with the circassians fleeing the russian conquest of the caucasus the decline of the ottoman empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence such as the hamidian massacres of armenians the young turk revolution in 1908 restored the ottoman constitution and parliament 30 years after their suspension by sultan abd lhamid ii in 1878 which is known
