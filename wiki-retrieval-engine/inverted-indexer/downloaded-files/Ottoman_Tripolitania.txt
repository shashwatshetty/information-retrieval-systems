bands of pirates the kingdom of spain occupied tripoli in 1510 but the spaniards were more concerned with controlling the port than with the inconveniences of administering a colony in 1530 the city along with malta and gozo were ceded by charles i of spain to the knights of st john as compensation for their recent expulsion from the island of rhodes at the hands of the ottoman turks christian rule lasted then until 1551 when tripoli was besieged and conquered by famed ottoman admirals sinan pasha and turgut reis declared as bey and later pasha of tripoli turgut reis submitted the tribes of the interior and several cities like misrata zuwara gharyan and gafsa in the next decade these efforts contributed to cement the foundations of a statal structure in what is today libya but control from constantinople remained loose at best much like in the rest of the barbary coast of north africa under the ottomans the maghreb was divided into three provinces algiers tunis and tripoli after 1565 administrative authority in tripoli was vested in a pasha directly appointed by the sultan in constantinople the sultan provided the pasha with a corps of janissaries which was in turn divided into a number of companies under the command of a junior officer or bey the janissaries quickly became the dominant force in ottoman libya as a self governing military guild answerable only to their own laws and protected by a divan a council of senior officers who advised the pasha the janissaries soon reduced the pasha to a largely ceremonial role the kingdom of tripoli royaume de tripoly is shown as including much of modern day libya with the exception of berdoa on a map by guillaume delisle 1707 in 1711 ahmed karamanli an ottoman cavalry officer and son of a turkish officer and libyan woman seized power and founded the karamanli dynasty which would last 124 years the 1793 95 tripolitanian civil war occurred in those years in may 1801 pasha yusuf karamanli demanded from the united states an increase in the tribute 83,000 which it had paid since 1796 for the protection of their commerce from piracy when the treaty of tripoli was signed the demand was refused by third american president thomas jefferson an american naval force was sent and blockaded tripoli and the desultory first barbary war dragged on from 1801 until 3 june 1805 the regency of tripoli was defeated by the newly revived united states navy the second barbary war 1815 also known as the algerian war was the second of the two wars fought between the united states and the ottoman empire s north african regencies of algiers tripoli and tunis known collectively as the barbary states in 1835 the government of sultan mahmud ii took advantage of local disturbances to reassert their direct authority and held it until the final collapse of the ottoman empire as decentralized ottoman power had resulted in the virtual independence of egypt as well as tripoli the coast and desert lying between them relapsed to anarchy even after direct ottoman control was resumed in tripoli the indigenous senussi movement led by islamic cleric sayyid mohammed ali as senussi called on the countryside to resist ottoman rule the grand senussi established his headquarters in the oasis town of jaghbub while his ikhwan brothers set up zawiyas religious colleges or monasteries across north africa and brought some stability to regions not known for their submission to central authority in line with the expressed instruction of the grand sanusi these gains were made largely without any coercion it was one of the first ottoman provinces to become a vilayet after an administrative reform in 1865 and by 1867 it had been reformed into the tripolitania vilayet the highpoint of the sanusi influence came in the 1880s under the grand senussi s son muhammad al mahdi as senussi who was a skilled administrator and a charismatic orator with 146 lodges spanning the entire sahara he moved the senussi capital to kufra harsh ottoman rule only fuelled the appeal of the senussi movement s call to repel foreign occupation remarkably mohammed al mahdi succeeded where so many had failed before him securing the enduring loyalty of the amazigh tribes of cyrenaica over a 75 year period the ottoman turks provided 33 governors and libya remained part of the empire although at times virtually autonomous until italy invaded for the second time in 1911 as the ottoman empire was collapsing main article italo turkish war the italo turkish war was fought between the ottoman empire and the kingdom of italy from september 29 1911 to october 18 1912 as a result of this conflict the ottoman turks ceded the provinces of tripolitania fezzan and cyrenaica to italy these provinces together formed what became known as libya sanjaks of the eyalet in the mid 19th century sanjak of benghazi became an independent sanjak in 1863 then became a province for a brief period but was made an independent sanjak once again
