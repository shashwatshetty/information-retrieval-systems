was originally confined to the area today known as the lace market and was surrounded by a substantial defensive ditch and rampart which fell out of use following the norman conquest and was filled by the time of the domesday survey 1086 following the norman conquest the saxon settlement developed into the english borough of nottingham and housed a town hall and law courts a settlement also developed around the castle on the hill opposite and was the french borough supporting the normans in the castle eventually the space between was built on as the town grew and the old market square became the focus of nottingham several centuries later defences consisted initially of a ditch and bank in the early 12th century the ditch was later widened in the mid-13th century and a stone wall built around much of the perimeter of the town a short length of the wall survives and is visible at the northern end of maid marian way and is protected as a scheduled monument on the return of
