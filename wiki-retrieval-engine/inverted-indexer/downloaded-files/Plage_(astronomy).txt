from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a plage is a bright region in the chromosphere of the sun typically found in regions of the chromosphere near sunspots the term itself is poetically taken from the french word for beach the plage regions map closely to the bright spots faculae in the photosphere below but the latter have much smaller spatial scales accordingly plage occurs most visibly near a sunspot region faculae have a strong influence on the solar constant and the more readily detectable because chromospheric plage areas traditionally are used to monitor this influence in this context active network consists of plage like brightenings extending away from active regions as their magnetism appears to diffuse into the quiet sun but constrained to follow the network boundaries because we can explain faculae with the strictly photospheric hot wall model what the actual physical relationship between plage and faculae may be is not clear encyclopedia of astrobiology astronomy spaceflight plage v t e the sun internal structure core radiation zone tachocline convection zone atmosphere photosphere supergranulation granule faculae sunspot chromosphere plage spicule moreton wave corona transition region coronal hole coronal loop coronal mass ejection prominence helmet streamer supra arcade downflows variation solar cycle list of solar cycles solar maximum solar minimum wolf number solar wind flare helioseismology heliosphere current sheet termination shock heliosheath heliopause bow shock related topics heliophysics solar activity solar astronomy solar dynamo eclipse solar energy solar neutrino solar observation solar phenomena solar physics solar system solar telescope solar time space weather standard solar model radiation spectral class g2v this article related to the sun is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title plage astronomy oldid 730096598 categories stellar astronomystellar phenomenasunsolar phenomenasun stubshidden categories all stub articles
