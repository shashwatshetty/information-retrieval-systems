from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a flip video camera formerly manufactured by cisco a video camera is a camera used for electronic motion picture acquisition as opposed to a movie camera which records images on film initially developed for the television industry but now common in other applications as well the earliest video cameras were those of john logie baird based on the mechanical nipkow disk and used in experimental broadcasts through the 1918s-1930s all electronic designs based on the video camera tube such as vladimir zworykin s iconoscope and philo farnsworth s image dissector supplanted the baird system by the 1930s these remained in wide use until the 1980s when cameras based on solid state image sensors such as ccds and later cmos active pixel sensors eliminated common problems with tube technologies such as image burn in and made digital video workflow practical the transition to digital tv gave a boost to digital video cameras and by the 2010s most video cameras were digital with the advent of digital video capture the distinction between professional video cameras and movie cameras has disappeared as the intermittent mechanism has become the same nowadays mid range cameras exclusively used for television and other work except movies are termed professional video cameras video cameras are used primarily in two modes the first characteristic of much early broadcasting is live television where the camera feeds real time images directly to a screen for immediate observation a few cameras still serve live television production but most live connections are for security military tactical and industrial operations where surreptitious or remote viewing is required in the second mode the images are recorded to a storage device for archiving or further processing for many years videotape was the primary format used for this purpose but was gradually supplanted by optical disc hard disk and then flash memory recorded video is used in television production and more often surveillance and monitoring tasks in which unattended recording of a situation is required for later analysis president barack obama and small business administration administrator karen mills shown onscreen during an east room event in the white house on 2009 modern video cameras have numerous designs and uses professional video cameras such as those used in television production may be television studio based or mobile in the case of an electronic field production efp such cameras generally offer extremely fine grained manual control for the camera operator often to the exclusion of automated operation they usually use three sensors to separately record red green and blue camcorders combine a camera and a vcr or other recording device in one unit these are mobile and were widely used for television production home movies electronic news gathering eng including citizen journalism and similar applications since the transition to digital video cameras most cameras have in built recording media and as such are also camcorders action camera s often have 360 recording capabilities closed circuit television cctv generally uses pan tilt zoom cameras ptz for security surveillance and or monitoring purposes such cameras are designed to be small easily hidden and able to operate unattended those used in industrial or scientific settings are often meant for use in environments that are normally inaccessible or uncomfortable for humans and are therefore hardened for such hostile environments e g radiation high heat or toxic chemical exposure webcams are video cameras which stream a live video feed to a computer camera phones have video cameras that are incorporated into mobile phones special camera systems are used for scientific research e g on board a satellite or a spaceprobe in artificial intelligence and robotics research and in medical use such cameras are often tuned for non
