from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search an etchplain is a plain where the bedrock has been subject to considerable etching or subsurface weathering contrary to what the name might suggest etchplains are seldom completely flat and usually display some relief as weathering of the bedrock does not advance uniformly this means that weathering is unrelated to the flatness which might be derivative of various other processes of planation including peneplanation and pediplanation erosion of etchplains can result in the exposure of inselbergs the term etchplain or etched peneplain was originally coined to describe surfaces in east africa by e j wayland in 1933 and bailey willis in 1936 this last geologist applied the term etched peneplain to the tanganyika plateau julius b del developed the concept further in the second half of the 20th century but never did use the term etchplain the term came for a long time to be associated with landscapes in the tropics or with a tropical climate since the 1980s the term has also been used to describe flat weathered landscapes at higher latitudes as climate changes arid and semi arid periods of pediplanation may alternate with more humid periods of etchplanation resulting in the formation of flattish surfaces peneplains of mixed origin polygenetic the african surface formed 70 40 million years ago is an example of an etchplain strandflat sub mesozoic hilly peneplains this geomorphology article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title etchplain oldid 827462860 categories weathering landformsgeomorphology stubshidden categories pages using citations with accessdate and no urlall stub articles
