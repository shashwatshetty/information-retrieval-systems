and offensive actions taken by u s marines well before the public was told about the actions all while president lyndon b johnson had been promising not to expand the war the document increased the

recording times politics editor carolyn ryan said it s a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories even in quotes and we discussed it at length ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because t o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what

shut down the three major new york city newspapers no editions of the new york times were printed two months into the strike a parody of the new york times called not the new york times was distributed in the city with contributors such as carl bernstein christopher cerf tony hendra and george plimpton the new york times editorial page is often regarded as liberal in mid-2004 the newspaper s then public editor ombudsman daniel okrent wrote that the op ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists only two of whom could be classified as conservative and even then of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and in the case of william safire opposes some central provisions of the patriot act the new york times has not endorsed a republican party member for president since dwight d eisenhower in 1956 since 1960 it has endorsed the democratic party nominee in every presidential election see new york times presidential endorsements however the new york times did endorse incumbent moderate republican mayors of new york city rudy giuliani in 1997 and michael bloomberg in 2005 and 2009 the times also endorsed republican new york state governor george pataki for re election in 2002 main article new york times controversies the new york times was criticized for the work of reporter walter duranty who served as its moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936 duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the soviet union and won a pulitzer prize for his work at that time however he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine most particularly the ukrainian famine in the 1930s in 2003 after the pulitzer board began a renewed inquiry the times hired mark von hagen professor of russian history at columbia university to review duranty s work von hagen found duranty s reports to be unbalanced and uncritical and that they far too often gave voice to stalinist propaganda in comments to the press he stated for the sake of the new york times honor they should take the prize away on november 14 2001 in the new york times 150th anniversary issue former executive editor max frankel wrote that before and during world war ii the ny times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the holocaust in their news pages laurel leff associate professor of journalism at northeastern university concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the third reich targeting of jews for genocide her 2005 book buried by the times documents the paper s tendency before during and after world war ii to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of jews while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the nazis crimes on jews in particular leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper s jewish publisher arthur hays sulzberger concerning jewishness antisemitism and zionism during the war the new york times journalist william l laurence was on the payroll of the war department in the mid to late 1950s fashion writer s were required to come up every month with articles whose total column inches reflected the relative advertising strength of every department or specialty store assigned to a writer the monitor of all this was the advertising director of the nyt however within this requirement story ideas may have been the reporters and editors own the new york times supported the 2003 invasion of iraq on may 26 2004 a year after the war started the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been and were insufficiently qualified frequently overly dependent upon information from iraqi exiles desiring regime change reporter judith miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead up to the iraq war was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the bush administration s position for which the new york times later apologized one of miller s prime sources was ahmed chalabi an iraqi expatriate who returned to iraq after the u s invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from may 2005 until may 2006 main article jayson blair plagiarism and fabrication scandal in may 2003 the new york times reporter jayson blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories some critics contended that african american blair s race was a major factor in his hiring and in the new york times initial reluctance to fire him the newspaper was criticized for largely reporting the prosecutors version of events in the 2006 duke lacrosse case suzanne smalley of newsweek criticized the newspaper for its credulous coverage of the charges of rape against duke university lacrosse players stuart taylor jr and kc johnson in their book until proven innocent political correctness and the shameful injustices of the duke lacrosse rape case write at the head of the guilt presuming pack the new york times vied in a race to the journalistic bottom with trash tv talk shows a 2003 study in the harvard international journal of press politics concluded that the new york times reporting was more favorable to israelis than to palestinians a 2002 study published in the journal journalism examined middle east coverage of the second intifada over a one month period in the times washington post and chicago tribune the study authors said that the times was the most slanted in a pro israeli direction with a bias reflected in its use of headlines photographs graphics sourcing practices and lead paragraphs for its coverage of the israeli palestinian conflict some such as ed koch have claimed that the paper is pro palestinian while others such as as ad abukhalil have insisted that it is pro israel the israel lobby and u s foreign policy by political science professors john mearsheimer and stephen walt alleges that the new york times sometimes criticizes israeli policies but is not even handed and is generally pro israel on the other hand the simon wiesenthal center has criticized the new york times for printing cartoons regarding the israeli palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti semitic israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity a piece in which thomas friedman commented that praise awarded to netanyahu during a speech at congress was paid for by the israel lobby elicited an apology and clarification from its writer the new york times public editor clark hoyt concluded in his january 10 2009 column though the most vociferous supporters of israel and the palestinians do not agree i think the new york times largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war has tried its best to do a fair balanced and complete job and has largely succeeded in february 2009 a village voice music blogger accused the newspaper of using chintzy ad hominem allegations in an article on british tamil music artist m i a concerning her activism against the sinhala tamil conflict in sri lanka m i a criticized the paper in january 2010 after a travel piece rated post conflict sri lanka the 1 place to go in 2010 in june 2010 the new york times magazine published a correction on its cover article of m i a acknowledging that the interview conducted by current w editor and then times magazine contributor lynn hirschberg contained a recontextualization of two quotes in response to the piece m i a broadcast hirschberg s phone number and secret audio recordings from the interview via her twitter and website the new york times was criticized for the 13 month delay of the december 2005 story revealing the u s national security agency warrantless surveillance program ex nsa officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists james risen and eric lichtblau who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in november 2004 weeks before america s presidential election contact with former agency officials began the previous summer former the new york times executive editor bill keller decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the bush administration and being advised not to do so by new york times washington bureau chief philip taubman keller explained the silence s rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013 stating three years after 9 11 we as a country were still under the influence of that trauma and we as a newspaper were not immune in 2014 pbs frontline interviewed risen and lichtblau who said that the newspaper s plan was to not publish the story at all the editors were furious at me risen said to the program they thought i was being insubordinate risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after the new york times declined the piece s publication and only released it after risen told them that he would publish the book another reporter told npr that the newspaper avoided disaster by ultimately publishing the story on june 16 2015 the new york times published an article reporting the deaths of six irish students staying in berkeley california when the balcony they were standing on collapsed the paper s story insinuating that they were to blame for the collapse the paper stated that the behavior of irish students coming to the us on j1 visas was an embarrassment to ireland the irish taoiseach and former president of ireland criticized the newspaper for being insensitive and inaccurate in its handling of the story in may 2015 a new york times expos by sarah maslin nir on the working conditions of manicurists in new york city and elsewhere and the health hazards to which they are exposed attracted wide attention resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by new york governor andrew m cuomo in july 2015 the story s claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former new york times reporter richard bernstein in the new york review of books bernstein whose wife owns two nail salons asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience and were not evidenced by ads in the chinese language papers cited by the story the new york times editorial staff subsequently answered bernstein s criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy the independent nyt public editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with bernstein and looked into his complaints and expressed her belief that the story s reporting was sound in september and october 2015 nail salon owners and workers protested at the new york times offices several times in response to the story and the ensuing new york state crackdown in october 2015 reason magazine published a three part re reporting of the story by jim epstein charging that the series was filled with misquotes and factual errors respecting both its claims of illegally low wages and health hazards epstein additionally argued that the new york times had mistranslated the ads cited in its answer to bernstein and that those ads actually validated bernstein s argument in november 2015 the new york times public editor concluded that the expos s findings and the language used to express them should have been dialed back in some instances substantially and recommended that the times write further follow up stories including some that re examine its original findings and that take on the criticism from salon owners and others not defensively but with an open mind a 2015 study found that the new york times fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias during the iranian nuclear crisis the newspaper minimized the negative processes of the united states while overemphasizing similar processes of iran this tendency was shared by other papers such as the guardian tehran times and the fars news agency while xinhua news agency was found to be more neutral while at the same time mimicking the foreign policy of the peoples republic of china in april 2016 two black female employees in their sixties filed a federal class action lawsuit against the new york times company ceo mark thompson and chief revenue officer meredith levien claiming age gender and racial discrimination the plaintiffs claim that the times advertising department favored younger white employees over older black employees in making firing and promotion decisions the times said that the suit was entirely without merit and was a series of recycled scurrilous and unjustified attacks new york times public editor ombudsman elizabeth spayd wrote in 2016 that conservatives and even many moderates see in the times a blue state worldview and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim but did opine that the times is part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country that in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources times executive editor dean baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias but that we have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in the new york times i want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world not just a segment of it it s a really difficult goal do we pull it off all the time no times public editor arthur brisbane wrote in 2012 when the times covers a national presidential campaign i have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance and usually succeed in doing so across the paper s many departments though so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism for lack of a better term that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of the times in mid-2004 the newspaper s then public editor daniel okrent wrote an opinion piece in which he said that the new york times did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and same sex marriage he stated that this bias reflected the paper s cosmopolitanism which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of new york city he wrote if you re examining the paper s coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor northeastern nor culturally seen it all if you are among the groups the times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide devout catholics gun owners orthodox jews texans if your value system wouldn t wear well on a composite new york times journalist then a walk through this paper can make you feel you re traveling in a strange and forbidding world okrent wrote that the times arts leisure the sunday times magazine and culture coverage trend to the left in december 2004 a university of california los angeles study by former fellows of a conservative think tank gave the new york times a score of 73.7 on a 100 point scale with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal making it the second most liberal major newspaper in the study after the wall street journal 85.1 the validity of the study has been questioned however the liberal watchdog group media matters for america pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author s funding and political scientists such as brendan nyhan cited flaws in the study s methodology donald trump has frequently criticized the new york times on his twitter account before and during his presidency since november 2015 trump has referred to the times as the failing new york times in a series of tweets despite trump s criticism new york times editor mark thompson noted that the paper had enjoyed soaring digital readership with the fourth quarter of 2016 seeing the highest number of new digital subscribers to the newspaper since 2011 critic matt taibbi accused the new york times of favoring hillary clinton over bernie sanders in the paper s news coverage of the 2016 democratic presidential primaries responding to the complaints of many readers new york times public editor margaret sullivan wrote that the times has not ignored mr sanders s campaign but it hasn t always taken it very seriously the tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive even mocking at times some of that is focused on the candidate s age appearance and style rather than what he has to say times senior editor carolyn ryan defended both the volume of new york times coverage noting that sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as jeb bush and marco rubio and its tone the times has developed a national and international reputation for thoroughness over time among journalists the paper is held in high regard a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the columbia journalism review found that the times was the best american paper ahead of the washington post the wall street journal and los angeles times the times also was ranked 1 in a 2011 quality ranking of u s newspapers by daniel de vise of the washington post the objective ranking took into account the number of recent pulitzer prizes won circulation and perceived web site quality a 2012 report in wnyc called the times the most respected newspaper in the world nevertheless like many other u s media sources the times had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the u s from 2004 to 2012 a pew research center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations among respondents who gave a rating 49 said that they believed all or most of the timess reporting while 50 disagreed a large percentage 19 of respondents were unable to rate believability the timess score was comparable to that of usa today media analyst brooke gladstone of wnyc s on the media writing for the new york times says that the decline in u s public trust of the mass media can be explained 1 by the rise of the polarized internet driven news 2 by a decline in trust in u s institutions more generally and 3 by the fact that americans say they want accuracy and impartiality but the polls suggest that actually most of us are seeking affirmation main article list of awards won by the new york times the new york times has won 122 pulitzer
