of words see ellipsis linguistics for the punctuation mark see ellipsis an ellipse red obtained as the intersection of a cone with an inclined plane ellipse notations ellipses examples in mathematics an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve as such it is a generalization of a circle which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location the shape of an ellipse how elongated it is is represented by its eccentricity which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 the limiting case of a circle to arbitrarily close to but less than 1 ellipses are the closed type of conic section a plane curve resulting from the intersection of a cone by a plane see figure to the right ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections parabolas and hyperbolas both of which are open and unbounded the cross section of a cylinder is an ellipse unless the section is parallel to the axis of the cylinder analytically an ellipse may also be defined as the set of points such that the ratio of the distance of each point on the curve from a given point called a focus or focal point to the distance from that same point on the curve to a given line called the directrix is a constant this ratio is called the eccentricity of the ellipse an ellipse may also be defined analytically as the set of points for each of which the sum of its distances to two foci is a fixed number ellipses are common in physics astronomy and engineering for example the orbit of each planet in our solar system is approximately an ellipse with the barycenter of the planet sun pair at one of the focal points the same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems having two astronomical bodies the shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids ellipses also arise as images of a circle under parallel projection and the bounded cases of perspective projection which are simply intersections of the projective cone with the plane of projection it is also the simplest lissajous figure formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency a similar effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics the name lleipsis omission was given by apollonius of perga in his conics emphasizing the connection of the curve with application of areas contents ellipse definition ellipse definition with director circle an ellipse can be defined geometrically as a set of points locus of points in the euclidean plane an ellipse is a set of points such that for any point of the set the sum of the distances to two fixed points the foci is constant usually denoted by in order to omit the special case of a line segment one assumes more formally for a given an ellipse is the set the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci is called the center of the ellipse the line through the foci is called the major axis and the line perpendicular to it through the center is called the minor axis it contains the vertices which have distance to the center the distance of the foci to the center is called the focal distance or linear eccentricity the quotient is the eccentricity the case yields a circle and is included the equation can be viewed in a different way see picture if is the circle with midpoint and radius then the distance of a point to the circle equals the distance to the focus is called the circular directrix related to focus of the ellipse this property should not be confused with the definition of an ellipse with help of a directrix line below using dandelin spheres one proves easily the important statement any plane section of a cone with a plane which does not contain the apex and whose slope is less than the slope of the lines on the cone is an ellipse shape parameters a semi major axis b semi minor axis c linear eccentricity p semi latus rectum if cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the ellipse and the x axis is the major axis and the foci are the points the vertices are for an arbitrary point the distance to the focus is and to the second focus hence the point is on the ellipse if the following condition is fulfilled remove the square roots by suitable squarings and use the relation to obtain the equation of the ellipse or solved for y the shape parameters are called the semi major and semi minor axes the points are the co vertices it follows from the equation that the ellipse is symmetric with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin the length of the chord through one of the foci which is perpendicular to the major axis of the ellipse is called the latus rectum one half of it is the semi latus rectum a calculation shows the semi latus rectum may also be viewed as the radius of curvature of the osculating circles at the vertices an arbitrary line intersects an ellipse at 0 1 or 2 points in the first case the line is called exterior line in the second case tangent and secant in the third case through any point of an ellipse there is exactly one tangent the tangent at a point of the ellipse has the coordinate equation a vector equation of the tangent is with proof let be an ellipse point and the vector equation of a line containing inserting the line s equation into the ellipse equation and respecting yields in case of line and the ellipse have only point in common and is a tangent the tangent direction is orthogonal to vector which is then a normal vector of the tangent and the tangent has the equation with a still unknown because is on the tangent and on the ellipse one gets in case of line has a second point with the ellipse in common with help of 1 one easily checks that is a tangent vector at point which proves the vector equation remark if and are two points of the ellipse such that holds then the points lie on two conjugate diameters of the ellipse see below in case of the ellipse is a circle and conjugate means orthogonal if the ellipse is shifted such that its center is the equation is the axes are still parallel to the x and y axes the construction of points based on the parametric equation and the interpretation of parameter t which is due to de la hire ellipse points calculated by the rational representation with equal spaced parameters standard parametric representation using the sine and cosine functions a parametric representation of the ellipse can be obtained parameter t can be taken as shown in the diagram and is due to de la hire the parameter t called the eccentric anomaly in astronomy is not the angle of with the x axis see diagram at right for other interpretations of parameter t see section drawing ellipses rational representation with the substitution and trigonometric formulae one gets and the rational parametric equation of an ellipse which covers any point of the ellipse except the left vertex for this formula represents the right upper quarter of the ellipse moving counter clockwise with increasing the left vertex is the limit rational representations of conic sections are popular with computer aided design see bezier curve tangent slope as parameter a parametric representation which uses the slope of the tangent at a point of the ellipse can be obtained from the derivative of the standard representation with help of trigonometric formulae one gets replacing und of the standard representation one yields where is the slope of the tangent at the corresponding ellipse point is the upper and the lower half of the ellipse the points with vertical tangents vertices are not covered by the representation the equation of the tangent at point has the form the still unknown can be determined by inserting the coordinates of the corresponding ellipse point this description of the tangents of an ellipse is an essential tool for the determination of the orthoptic of an ellipse the orthoptic article contains another proof which omits differential calculus and trigonometric formulae shifted ellipse a shifted ellipse with center can be described by a parametric representation of an arbitrary ellipse is contained in the section ellipse as an affine image of the unit circle x y 1 below the parameters and represent the lengths of line segments and are therefore non negative real numbers throughout this article is the semi major axis i e in general the canonical ellipse equation may have and hence the ellipse would be taller than it is wide in this form the semi major axis would be this form can be converted to the form assumed in the remainder of this article simply by transposing the variable names and and the parameter names and ellipse directrix property the two lines at distance and parallel to the minor axis are called directrices of the ellipse see diagram for an arbitrary point of the ellipse the quotient of the distance to one focus and to the corresponding directrix see diagram is equal to the eccentricity the proof for the pair follows from the fact that and satisfy the equation the second case is proven analogously the inverse statement is also true and can be used to define an ellipse in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola for any point focus any line directrix not through and any real number with the set of points locus of points for which the quotient of the distances to the point and to the line is is an ellipse the choice which is the eccentricity of a circle is in this context not allowed one may consider the directrix of a circle to be the line at infinity the choice yields a parabola and if a hyperbola pencil of conics with a common vertex and common semi latus rectum proof let and assume is a point on the curve the directrix has equation with the relation produces the equations and the substitution yields this is the equation of an ellipse or a parabola or a hyperbola all of these non degenerate conics have in common the origin as a vertex see diagram if introduce new parameters so that and then the equation above becomes which is the equation of an ellipse with center the x axis as major axis and the major minor semi axis general case if the focus is and the directrix one gets the equation the right side of the equation uses the hesse normal form of a line to calculate the distance ellipse the tangent bisects the angle between the lines to the foci rays from one focus pass through the other focus for an ellipse the following statement is true the normal at a point bisects the angle between the lines proof because the tangent is perpendicular to the normal the statement is true for the tangent and the complementary angle of the lines to the foci see diagram too let be the point on the line with the distance to the focus is the semi major axis of the ellipse line is the bisector of the angle between the lines in order to prove that is the tangent line at point one checks that any point on line which is different from cannot be on the ellipse hence has only point in common with the ellipse and is therefore the tangent at point from the diagram and the triangle inequality one recognizes that holds which means but if is a point of the ellipse the sum should be application the rays from one focus are reflected by the ellipse to the second focus this property has optical and acoustic applications similar to the reflective property of a parabola see whispering gallery ellipse as an affine image of the unit circle another definition of an ellipse uses affine transformations any ellipse is the affine image of the unit circle with equation an affine transformation of the euclidean plane has the form where is a regular matrix its determinant is not 0 and is an arbitrary vector if are the column vectors of the matrix the unit circle is mapped onto the ellipse is the center are the directions of two conjugate diameters of the ellipse in general the vectors are not perpendicular that means in general and are not the vertices of the ellipse the tangent vector at point is because at a vertex the tangent is perpendicular to the major minor axis diameters of the ellipse one gets the parameter of a vertex from the equation and hence the formulae were used if then the 4 vertices of the ellipse are the advantage of this definition is that one gets a simple parametric representation of an arbitrary ellipse even in the space if the vectors are vectors of the euclidean space orthogonal diameters of a circle with a square of tangents midpoints of parallel chords and an affine image which is an ellipse with conjugate diameters a parallelogram of tangents and midpoints of chords for a circle m the midpoints of parallel chords lie on a diameter the diameter and the parallel chords are orthogonal an affine transformation in general does not preserve orthogonality but does preserve parallelism and midpoints of line segments hence property m which omits the term orthogonal is true for any ellipse definition two diameters of an ellipse are conjugate if the midpoints of chords parallel to lie on from the diagram one finds t two diameters of an ellipse are conjugate if the tangents at and are parallel to and visa versa the term conjugate diameters is a kind of generalization of orthogonal considering the parametric equation of an ellipse any pair of points belong to a diameter and the pair belongs to its conjugate diameter ellipse with its orthoptic main article orthoptic geometry for the ellipse the intersection points of orthogonal tangents lie on the circle this circle is called orthoptic of the given ellipse ellipse theorem of apollonios on conjugate diameters for an ellipse with semi axes the following is true let and be halves of two conjugate diameters see diagram then 1 2 the triangle formed by has the constant area 3 the parallelogram of tangents adjacent to the given conjugate diameters has the proof let the ellipse be in the canonical form with parametric equation the two points are on conjugate diameters see previous section from trigonometric formulae one gets and the area of the triangle generated by is and from the diagram it can be seen that the area of the parallelogram is 8 times that of hence central projection of circles gate ellipses appear in descriptive geometry as images parallel or central projection of circles for details see ellipses in dg german so it is essential to have tools to draw an ellipse nowadays the best tool is the computer during the times before this tool was not available and one was restricted to compass and ruler for the construction of single points of an ellipse but there are technical tools ellipsographs to draw an ellipse in a continuous way like a compass for drawing a circle too the principle of ellipsographs were known to greek mathematicians archimedes proklos already if there is no ellipsograph available the best and quickest way to draw an ellipse is to draw an approximation by the four osculating circles at the vertices for any method described below the knowledge of the axes and the semi axes is necessary or equivalent the foci and the semi major axis if this presumption is not fulfilled one has to know at least two conjugate diameters with help of rytz s construction the axes and semi axes can be retrieved ellipse gardener s method the characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins a length of string and a pencil in this method pins are pushed into the paper at two points which become the ellipse s foci a string tied at each end to the two pins and the tip of a pencil pulls the loop taut to form a triangle the tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut using two pegs and a rope gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed thus it is called the gardener s ellipse a similar method for drawing confocal ellipses with a closed string is due to the irish bishop charles graves the two following methods rely on the parametric representation see section parametric representation above this representation can be modeled technically by two simple methods in both cases center the axes and semi axes have to be known method 1 the first method starts with a strip of paper of length the point where the semi axes meet is marked by if the strip slides with both ends on the axes of the desired ellipse then point p traces the ellipse for the proof one shows that point has the parametric representation where parameter is the angle of the slope of the paper strip a technichal realization of the motion of the paper strip can be achieved by a tusi couple s animation the device is able to draw any ellipse with a fixed sum which is the radius of the large circle this restriction may be a disadvantage in real life more flexible is the second paper strip method a nice application if one stands somewhere in the middle of a ladder which stands on a slippery ground and leans on a slippery wall the ladder slides down and the persons feet trace an ellipse ellipse construction paper strip method 1 ellipses with tusi couple two examples red and cyan a variation of the paper strip method 1 uses the observation that the midpoint of the paper strip is moving on the circle with center of the ellipse and radius hence the paperstrip can be cut at point into halves connected again by a joint at and the sliding end fixed at the center see diagram after this operation the movement of the unchanged half of the paperstrip is unchanged the advantage of this variation is only one expensive sliding shoe is necessary one should be aware that the end which is sliding on the minor axis has to be changed variation of the paper strip method 1 animation of the variation of the paper strip method 1 ellipse construction paper strip method 2 method 2 the second method starts with a strip of paper of length one marks the point which divides the strip into two substrips of length and the strip is positioned onto the axes as described in the diagram then the free end of the strip traces an ellipse while the strip is moved for the proof one recognizes that the tracing point can be described parametrically by where parameter is the angle of slope of the paper strip this method is the base for several ellipsographs see section below remark similar to the variation of the paper strip method 1 a variation of the paper strip method 2 can be established see diagram by cutting the part between the axes into halves trammel of archimedes principle ellipsograph due to benjamin bramer variation of the paper strip method 2 approximation of an ellipse with osculating circles from section metric properties one gets the radius of curvature at the vertices is the radius of curvature at the co vertices is the diagram shows an easy way to find the centers of curvature at vertex and co vertex resp 1 mark the auxiliary point and draw the linesegment 2 draw the line through which is perpendicular to the line 3 the intersection points of this line with the axes are the centers of the osculating circles proof simple calculation the centers for the remaining vertices are found by symmetry with help of a french curve one draws a curve which has smooth contact to the osculating circles ellipse steiner generation ellipse steiner generation the following method to construct single points of an ellipse relies on the steiner generation of a non degenerate conic section given two pencils of lines at two points all lines containing and respectively and a projective but not perspective mapping of onto then the intersection points of corresponding lines form a non degenerate projective conic section for the generation of points of the ellipse one uses the pencils at the vertices let be an upper co vertex of the ellipse and is the center of the rectangle the side of the rectangle is divided into n equal spaced line segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal as direction onto the line segment and assign the division as shown in the diagram the parallel projection together with the reverse of the orientation is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at and needed the intersection points of any two related lines and are points of the uniquely defined ellipse with help of the points the points of the second quarter of the ellipse can be determined analogously one gets the points of the lower half of the ellipse remark the steiner generation exists for hyperbolas and parabolas too the steiner generation is sometimes called a parallelogram method because one can use other points rather than the vertices which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle most technical instruments for drawing ellipses are based on the second paperstrip method ellipsenzirkel german drawing instruments for more principles of ellipsographs ellipsographe french circle inscribed angle theorem a circle with equation is uniquely determined by three points not on a line a simple way to determine the parameters uses the inscribed angle theorem for circles for four points see diagram the following statement is true the four points are on a circle if and only if the angles at and are equal usually one measures inscribed angles by degree or radian in order to get an equation of a circle determined by three points the following measurement is more convenient in order to measure an angle between two lines with equations one uses the quotient this expression is the cotangent of the angle between the two lines inscribed angle theorem for circles for four points no three of them on a line see diagram the following statement is true the four points are on a circle if and only if the angles at and are equal in the sense of the measurement above that means if at first the masure is available for chords which are not parallel to the y axis only but the final formula works for any chord a consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for circles is the 3 point form of a circle s equation one gets the equation of the circle determined by 3 points not on a line by a conversion of the equation in this section one considers ellipses with an equation where the ratio is fixed with the abbreviation one gets the more convenient form and fixed such ellipses have their axes parallel to the coordinate axes and their eccentricity fixed their major axes are parallel to the x axis if and parallel to the y axis if inscribed angle theorem for an ellipse like a circle such an ellipse is determined by three points not on a line in this more general case one introduces the following measurement of an angle in order to measure an angle between two lines with equations one uses the quotient for four points no three of them on a line see diagram the following statement is true the four points are on an ellipse with equation if and only if the angles at and are equal in the sense of the measurement above that is if at first the measure is available only for chords which are not parallel to the y axis but the final formula works for any chord the proof follows from a straightforward calculation for the direction of proof given that the points are on an ellipse one can assume that the center of the ellipse is the origin a consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for ellipses is the 3 point form of an ellipse s equation one gets the equation of the ellipse determined by 3 points not on a line by a conversion of the equation ellipse pole polar relation any ellipse can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation the equation of the tangent at a point of the ellipse is if one allows point to be an arbitrary point different from the origin then point is mapped onto the line not through the center of the ellipse this relation between points and lines is a bijection the inverse function maps line onto the point and line onto the point such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called pole polar relation or just polarity the pole is the point the polar the line see pole and polar by calculation one checks the following properties of the pole polar relation of the ellipse for a point pole on the ellipse the polar is the tangent at this point see diagram for a pole outside the ellipse the intersection points of its polar with the ellipse are the tangency points of the two tangents passing see diagram for a point within the ellipse the polar has no point with the ellipse in common see diagram remarks the intersection point of two polars is the pole of the line through their poles the foci and respectively and the directrices and respectively belong to pairs of pole and polar pole polar relations exist for hyperbolas and parabolas too all metric properties given below refer to an ellipse with equation the area enclosed by an ellipse is where and are the lengths of the semi major and semi minor axes respectively the area formula is intuitive start with a circle of radius so its area is and stretch it by a factor to make an ellipse this scales the area by the same factor it is also easy to rigorously prove the area formula using integration as follows equation 1 can be rewritten as for this curve is the top half of the ellipse so twice the integral of over the interval will be the area of the ellipse the second integral is the area of a circle of radius that is so an ellipse defined implicitly by has area the circumference of an ellipse is where again is the length of the semi major axis is the eccentricity and the function is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind which calculates the circumference of the ellipse in the first quadrant alone and the formula for the circumference of an ellipse can thus be written the arc length of an ellipse in general has no closed form solution in terms of elementary functions elliptic integrals were motivated by this problem equation 3 may be evaluated directly using the carlson symmetric form this gives a succinct and quadratically converging iterative method for evaluating the circumference using the arithmetic geometric mean the exact infinite series is where is the double factorial unfortunately this series converges rather slowly however by expanding in terms of ivory and bessel derived an expression that converges much more rapidly ramanujan gives two good approximations for the circumference in 16 of modular equations and approximations to they are and the errors in these approximations which were obtained empirically are of order and respectively more generally the arc length of a portion of the circumference as a function of the angle subtended is given by an incomplete elliptic integral see also meridian arc meridian distance on the ellipsoid the inverse function the angle subtended as a function of the arc length is given by the elliptic functions some lower and upper bounds on the circumference of the canonical ellipse with are here the upper bound is the circumference of a circumscribed concentric circle passing through the endpoints of the ellipse s major axis and the lower bound is the perimeter of an inscribed rhombus with vertices at the endpoints of the major and minor axes the curvature is given by radius of curvature at point radius of curvature at the two vertices and the centers of curvature radius of curvature at the two co vertices and the centers of curvature in analytic geometry the ellipse is defined as a quadric the set of points of the cartesian plane that in non degenerate cases satisfy the implicit equation provided to distinguish the degenerate cases from the non degenerate case let be the determinant that is then the ellipse is a non degenerate real ellipse if and only if c 0 if c 0 we have an imaginary ellipse and if 0 we have a point ellipse the general equation s coefficients can be obtained from known semi major axis semi minor axis center coordinates and rotation angle using the following formulae these expressions can be derived from the canonical equation see next section by substituting the coordinates with expressions for rotation and translation of the coordinate system let through change of coordinates a rotation of axes and a translation of axes the general ellipse can be described by the canonical implicit equation here are the point coordinates in the canonical system whose origin is the center of the ellipse whose axis is the unit vector coinciding with the major axis and whose axis is the perpendicular vector coinciding with the minor axis that is and in this system the center is the origin and the foci are and any ellipse can be obtained by rotation and translation of a canonical ellipse with the proper semi diameters the expression of an ellipse centered at is moreover any canonical ellipse can be obtained by scaling the unit circle of defined by the equation by factors a and b along the two axes for an ellipse in canonical form we have the distances from a point on the ellipse to the left and right foci are and respectively the canonical form coefficients can be obtained from the general form coefficients using the following equations where is the angle from the positive horizontal axis to the ellipse s major axis polar coordinates centered at the center in polar coordinates with the origin at the center of the ellipse and with the angular coordinate measured from the major axis the ellipse s equation is polar coordinates centered at focus if instead we use polar coordinates with the origin at one focus with the angular coordinate still measured from the major axis the ellipse s equation is where the sign in the denominator is negative if the reference direction points towards the center as illustrated on the right and positive if that direction points away from the center in the slightly more general case of an ellipse with one focus at the origin and the other focus at angular coordinate the polar form is the angle in these formulas is called the true anomaly of the point the numerator of these formulas is the semi latus rectum of the ellipse usually denoted it is the distance from a focus of the ellipse to the ellipse itself measured along a line perpendicular to the major axis an ellipse in red as a special case of the hypotrochoid with r 2r the ellipse is a special case of the hypotrochoid when r 2r as shown in the adjacent image the special case of a moving circle with radius inside a circle with radius is called a tusi couple ellipses appear as plane sections of the following quadrics ellipsoid elliptic cone elliptic cylinder hyperboloid of one sheet hyperboloid of two sheets ellipsoid elliptic cone elliptic cylinder hyperboloid of one sheet hyperboloid of two sheets see also fresnel zone if the water s surface is disturbed at one focus of an elliptical water tank the circular waves of that disturbance after reflecting off the walls converge simultaneously to a single point the second focus this is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall bouncing path between the two foci similarly if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic mirror all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus since no other smooth curve has such a property it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse in the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center if the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror specifically a prolate spheroid this property holds for all rays out of the source alternatively a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper such mirrors are used in some document scanners sound waves are reflected in a similar way so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus remarkably well the effect is even more evident under a vaulted roof shaped as a section of a prolate spheroid such a room is called a whisper chamber the same effect can be demonstrated with two reflectors shaped like the end caps of such a spheroid placed facing each other at the proper distance examples are the national statuary hall at the united states capitol where john quincy adams is said to have used this property for eavesdropping on political matters the mormon tabernacle at temple square in salt lake city utah at an exhibit on sound at the museum of science and industry in chicago in front of the university of illinois at urbana champaign foellinger auditorium and also at a side chamber of the palace of charles v in the alhambra main article elliptic orbit in the 17th century johannes kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the sun are ellipses with the sun approximately at one focus in his first law of planetary motion later isaac newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation more generally in the gravitational two body problem if the two bodies are bound to each other that is the total energy is negative their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse the other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance interestingly the orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse with the other body at the same focus keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance thus in principle the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse however this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed for elliptical orbits useful relations involving the eccentricity are where is the radius at apoapsis the farthest distance is the radius at periapsis the closest distance is the length of the semi major axis also in terms of and the semi major axis is their arithmetic mean the semi minor axis is their geometric mean and the semi latus rectum is their harmonic mean in other words the general solution for a harmonic oscillator in two or more dimensions is also an ellipse such is the case for instance of a long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic spring or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor unlike keplerian orbits however these harmonic orbits have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse and have fairly simple equations of motion in electronics the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope if the display is an ellipse rather than a straight line the two signals are out of phase two non circular gears with the same elliptical outline each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times alternatively they can be connected by a link chain or timing belt or in the case of a bicycle the main chainring may be elliptical or an ovoid similar to an ellipse in form such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable angular speed or torque from a constant rotation of the driving axle or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying mechanical advantage elliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears an example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine the bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base in a material that is optically anisotropic birefringent the refractive index depends on the direction of the light the dependency can be described by an index ellipsoid if the material is optically isotropic this ellipsoid is a sphere in lamp pumped solid state lasers elliptical cylinder shaped reflectors have been used to direct light from the pump lamp coaxial with one ellipse focal axis to the active medium rod coaxial with the second focal axis in laser plasma produced euv light sources used in microchip lithography euv light is generated by plasma positioned in the primary focus of an ellipsoid mirror and is collected in the secondary focus at the input of the lithography machine in statistics a bivariate random vector x y is jointly elliptically distributed if its iso density contours loci of equal values of the density function are ellipses the concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector in which case in general the iso density contours are ellipsoids a special case is the multivariate normal distribution the elliptical distributions are important in finance because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance that is any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return drawing an ellipse as a graphics primitive is common in standard display libraries such as the macintosh quickdraw api and direct2d on windows jack bresenham at ibm is most famous for the invention of 2d drawing primitives including line and circle drawing using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit m l v pitteway extended bresenham s algorithm for lines to conics in 1967 another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in 1984 by jerry van aken in 1970 danny cohen presented at the computer graphics 1970 conference in england a linear algorithm for drawing ellipses and circles in 1971 l b smith published similar algorithms for all conic sections and proved them to have good properties these algorithms need only a few multiplications and additions to calculate each vector it is beneficial to use a parametric formulation in computer graphics because the density of points is greatest where there is the most curvature thus the change in slope between each successive point is small reducing the apparent jaggedness of the approximation drawing with b zier paths composite b zier curves may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy since any ellipse may be construed as an affine transformation of a circle the spline methods used to draw a circle may be used to draw an ellipse since the constituent b zier curves behave appropriately under such transformations it is sometimes useful to find the minimum
