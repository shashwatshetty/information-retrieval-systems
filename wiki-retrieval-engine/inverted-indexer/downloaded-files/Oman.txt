containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools belonging to a regionally specific african lithic industry the late nubian complex known previously only from the northeast and horn of africa two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates place the arabian nubian complex at 106,000 years old this supports the proposition that early human populations moved from africa into arabia during the late pleistocene in recent years known primarily from survey finds palaeolithic and neolithic sites have come to light most on the eastern coast main palaeolithic sites include saiwan ghunaim in the barr al hikman archaeological remains are particularly numerous for the bronze age umm an nar and wadi suq periods sites such as baat show accomplished wheel turned pottery an excellent hand made stone vessels a metals industry and monumental architecture the early 1300 300 bc and late iron ages 100 bc 300 ad show more differences than similarities to each other thereafter until the

ancient copper resources mazoon a persian name used for the region over centuries tribes from the west settled in oman making a living by fishing farming herding or stock breeding and many present day omani families trace their ancestral roots to other parts of arabia when the emigrants from northern western and south western arabia arrived in oman they had to compete with the indigenous population for the best arable land oman late iron age sites in the 1970s and 1980s scholars like john c wilkinson believed by virtue of oral history that in the 6th century bc the achaemenids exerted control over the omani peninsula most likely ruling from a coastal center such as suhar central oman has its own indigenous samad late iron age cultural assemblage named eponymously from samad al shan in the northern part of the oman peninsula the recent pre islamic period begins in the 3rd century bce and extends into the 3rd century ce whether or not persians brought south eastern arabian under their control is a moot point since the lack of persian finds speak against this belief four centuries later omanis came in contact with and accepted islam the conversion of oman is usually ascribed to amr ibn al as who was sent by the prophet muhammad during the expedition of zaid ibn haritha hisma seydi ali reis and his galleys taken in an ambush by portuguese forces while trying to bring back his flotilla from basra to suez in august 1554 a decade after vasco da gama s successful voyage around the cape of good hope and to india in 1497 98 the portuguese arrived in oman and occupied muscat for a 143 year period from 1507 to 1650 their fortress still remains in need of an outpost to protect their sea lanes the portuguese built up and fortified the city where remnants of their colonial architectural style still exist an ottoman fleet captured muscat in 1552 during the fight for control of the persian gulf and the indian ocean the ottoman turks captured muscat from the portuguese in 1581 and held it until 1588 rebellious tribes eventually drove out the portuguese but were themselves pushed out about a century later in 1741 by the leader of an omani tribe who began the current line of ruling sultans except for a brief persian invasion in the late 1740s oman has been self governing ever since the sultan s palace in zanzibar which was once oman s capital and residence of its sultans in the 1690s saif bin sultan the imam of oman pressed down the swahili coast a major obstacle to his progress was fort jesus housing the garrison of a portuguese settlement at mombasa after a two year siege the fort fell to bin sultan in 1698 thereafter the omanis easily ejected the portuguese from zanzibar and from all other coastal regions north of mozambique the persians invaded oman in 1737 they were driven out in 1749 when the al said dynasty came to power it continues to rule oman to this day zanzibar was a valuable property as the main slave market of the swahili coast and became an increasingly important part of the omani empire a fact reflected by the decision of the 19th century imam of muscat sa id ibn sultan to make it his main place of residence in 1837 sa id built impressive palaces and gardens in zanzibar rivalry between his two sons was resolved with the help of forceful british diplomacy when one of them majid succeeded to zanzibar and to the many regions claimed by the family on the swahili coast the other son thuwaini inherited muscat and oman zanzibar influences in the comoros archipelago in the indian ocean indirectly introduced omani customs to the comorian culture these influences include clothing traditions and wedding ceremonies in 1783 oman s seyyid sultan defeated ruler of muscat was granted sovereignty over gwadar this coastal city is

imam ghalib alhinai were ruptured over a dispute concerning the right to grant oil concessions a subsidiary of the iraq petroleum company was intensely interested in some promising geological formations near fahud under the terms of the 1920 treaty of seeb the sultan claimed all dealings with the oil company as his prerogative the imam on the other hand claimed that since the oil was in his territory anything dealing with it was an internal matter bahla fort in december 1955 sultan said bin taimur sent troops of the muscat and oman field force to occupy the main centres in oman including nizwa the capital of the imamate of oman and ibri imam ghalib alhinai and his younger brother talib bin ali alhinai led the imamate of oman in the jebel akhdar war against sultan said bin
