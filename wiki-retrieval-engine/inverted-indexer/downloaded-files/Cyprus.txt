archaeological remains from this period include the well preserved neolithic village of khirokitia and cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world cyprus was settled by mycenaean greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium bc as a strategic location in the middle east it was subsequently occupied by several major powers including the empires of the assyrians egyptians and persians from whom the island was seized in 333 bc by alexander the great subsequent rule by ptolemaic egypt the classical and eastern roman empire arab caliphates for a short period the french lusignan dynasty and the venetians was followed by over three centuries of ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 de jure until 1914 cyprus was placed under british administration based on the cyprus convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by britain in 1914 while turkish cypriots made up 18 of the population the partition of cyprus and creation of a turkish state in the north became a policy of turkish cypriot leaders and turkey in the 1950s turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of cyprus to turkey as cyprus was considered an extension of anatolia by them while since the 19th century the majority greek cypriot population and its orthodox church had been pursuing union with greece which became a greek national policy in the 1950s following nationalist violence in the 1950s cyprus was granted independence in 1960 in 1963 the 11 year intercommunal violence between greek cypriots and turkish cypriots started which displaced more than 25,000 turkish cypriots and brought the end of turkish cypriot representation in the republic on 15 july 1974 a coup d tat was staged by greek cypriot nationalists and elements of the greek military junta in an attempt at enosis the incorporation of cyprus into greece this action precipitated the turkish invasion of cyprus on 20 july which led to the capture of the present day territory of northern cyprus in the following month after a ceasefire collapsed and the displacement of over 150,000 greek cypriots and 50,000 turkish cypriots a separate turkish cypriot state in the north was established by unilateral declaration in 1983 the move was widely condemned by the international community with turkey alone recognizing the new state these events and the resulting political situation are matters of a continuing dispute the republic of cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the entire island including its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone with the exception of the sovereign base areas of akrotiri and dhekelia which remain under british control according to the london and z rich agreements however the republic of cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts the area under the effective control of the republic located in the south and west and comprising about 59 of the island s area and the north administered by the self declared turkish republic of northern cyprus covering about 36 of the island s area another nearly 4 of the island s area is covered by the un buffer zone the international community considers the northern part of the island as territory of the republic of cyprus occupied by turkish forces the occupation is viewed as illegal under international law amounting to illegal occupation of eu territory since cyprus became a member of the european union cyprus is a major tourist destination in the mediterranean with an advanced high income economy and a very high human development index the republic of cyprus has been a member of the

became part of the east roman or byzantine empire and would remain so until the crusades some 800 years later under byzantine rule the greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong hellenistic christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the greek cypriot community beginning in 649 cyprus suffered from devastating raids launched by muslim armies from the levant which continued for the next 300 years many were quick piratical raids but others were large scale attacks in which many cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed there are no byzantine churches which survive from this period thousands of people were killed and many cities such as salamis were destroyed and never rebuilt byzantine rule was restored in

fearing the worst the venetians also fortified famagusta and kyrenia although the lusignan french aristocracy remained the dominant social class in cyprus throughout the medieval period the former

abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to cyprus under which non muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities in a reversal from the days of latin rule the head of the church of cyprus was invested as leader of the greek cypriot population and acted as mediator between christian greek cypriots and the ottoman authorities this status

president ioannis kapodistrias called for union of cyprus with greece and numerous minor uprisings took place reaction to ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both greek and turkish cypriots although none were successful after centuries of neglect by the turks the unrelenting poverty of most of the people and the ever present tax collectors fuelled greek nationalism and by the 20th century idea of

in response to the militant activity of eoka the turkish cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self determination from greek cypriots meanwhile in the 1950s turkish leader menderes considered cyprus an extension of anatolia rejected the partition of cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to turkey nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that cyprus is turkish and the ruling party declared cyprus to be a part of the turkish homeland that was vital to its security upon realising the fact that the turkish cypriot population was only 20 of the islanders made annexation unfeasible the national policy was changed to favour partition the slogan partition or death was frequently used in turkish cypriot and turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s although after the z rich and london conferences turkey seemed to accept the existence of the cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island the goal of the turkish and turkish cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent turkish state in the northern part of the island in january 1950 the church of cyprus organised a referendum under the supervision of clerics and with no turkish cypriot participation

given to turkish cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the akritas plan which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of greek cypriots persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating turkish cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan tensions were heightened when cypriot president archbishop makarios iii called for constitutional changes which were rejected by turkey and opposed by turkish cypriots intercommunal violence erupted on 21 december 1963 when two turkish cypriots

president lyndon b johnson on 5 june warning that the us would not stand beside turkey in case of a consequential soviet invasion of turkish territory meanwhile by 1964 enosis was a greek policy that could not be abandoned makarios and the greek prime minister georgios papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and king constantine wished cyprus a speedy union with the mother country
