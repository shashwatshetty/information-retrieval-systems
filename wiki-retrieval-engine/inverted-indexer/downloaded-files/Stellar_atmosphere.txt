from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search photo taken in france during the 1999 eclipse the stellar atmosphere is the outer region of the volume of a star lying above the stellar core radiation zone and convection zone it is divided into several regions of distinct character the photosphere which is the atmosphere s lowest and coolest layer is normally its only visible part light escaping from the surface of the star stems from this region and passes through the higher layers the sun s photosphere has a temperature in the 5,770 k to 5,780 k range starspots cool regions of disrupted magnetic field lie on the photosphere above the photosphere lies the chromosphere this part of the atmosphere first cools down and then starts to heat up to about 10 times the temperature of the photosphere above the chromosphere lies the transition region where the temperature increases rapidly on a distance of only around 100 km the outermost part of the stellar atmosphere is the corona a tenuous plasma which has a temperature above one million kelvin while all stars on the main sequence feature transition regions and coronae not all evolved stars do so it seems that only some giants and very few supergiants possess coronae an unresolved problem in stellar astrophysics is how the corona can be heated to such high temperatures the answer lies in magnetic fields but the exact mechanism remains unclear during a total solar eclipse the photosphere of the sun is obscured revealing its atmosphere s other layers observed during eclipse the sun s chromosphere appears briefly as a thin pinkish arc and its corona is seen as a tufted halo the same phenomenon in eclipsing binaries can make the chromosphere of giant stars visible cecilia payne gaposchkin who first proposed the presently accepted composition of stellar atmospheres v t e the sun internal structure core radiation zone tachocline convection zone atmosphere photosphere supergranulation granule faculae sunspot chromosphere plage spicule moreton wave corona transition region coronal hole coronal loop coronal mass ejection prominence helmet streamer supra arcade downflows variation solar cycle list of solar cycles solar maximum solar minimum wolf number solar wind flare helioseismology heliosphere current sheet termination shock heliosheath heliopause bow shock related topics heliophysics solar activity solar astronomy solar dynamo eclipse solar energy solar neutrino solar observation solar phenomena solar physics solar system solar telescope solar time space weather standard solar model radiation spectral class g2v v t e atmospheres star sun exoplanet hd 209458 b kepler-7b planet mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune dwarf planet ceres pluto makemake satellite callisto dione enceladus europa ganymede io moon rhea titan triton see also coma cometary extraterrestrial atmosphere stellar atmosphere retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title stellar atmosphere oldid 828137954 categories stellar astronomy
