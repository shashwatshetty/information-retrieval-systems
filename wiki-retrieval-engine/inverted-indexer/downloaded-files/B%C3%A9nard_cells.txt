from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search b nard cells rayleigh b nard convection is a type of natural convection occurring in a plane horizontal layer of fluid heated from below in which the fluid develops a regular pattern of convection cells known as b nard cells rayleigh b nard convection is one of the most commonly studied convection phenomena because of its analytical and experimental accessibility the convection patterns are the most carefully examined example of self organizing nonlinear systems buoyancy and hence gravity is responsible for the appearance of convection cells the initial movement is the upwelling of lesser density fluid from the heated bottom layer this upwelling spontaneously organizes into a regular pattern of cells contents the features of rayleigh b nard convection can be obtained by a simple experiment first conducted by henri b nard a french physicist in 1900 convection cells in a gravity field the experimental set up uses a layer of liquid e g water between two parallel planes the height of the layer is small compared to the horizontal dimension at first the temperature of the bottom plane is the same as the top plane the liquid will then tend towards an equilibrium where its temperature is the same as its surroundings once there the liquid is perfectly uniform to an observer it would appear the same from any position this equilibrium is also asymptotically stable after a local temporary perturbation of the outside temperature it will go back to its uniform state in line with the second law of thermodynamics then the temperature of the bottom plane is increased slightly yielding a flow of thermal energy conducted through the liquid the system will begin to have a structure of thermal conductivity the temperature and the density and pressure with it will vary linearly between the bottom and top plane a uniform linear gradient of temperature will be established this system may be modelled by statistical mechanics once conduction is established the microscopic random movement spontaneously becomes ordered on a macroscopic level forming benard convection cells with a characteristic correlation length simulation of rayleigh b nard convection in 3d the rotation of the cells is stable and will alternate from clock wise to counter clockwise horizontally this is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking b nard cells are metastable this means that a small perturbation will not be able to change the rotation of the cells but a larger one could affect the rotation they exhibit a form of hysteresis moreover the deterministic law at the microscopic level produces a non deterministic arrangement of the cells if the experiment is repeated a particular position in the experiment will be in a clockwise cell in some cases and a counter clockwise cell in others microscopic perturbations of the initial conditions are enough to produce a non deterministic macroscopic effect that is in principle there is no way to calculate the macroscopic effect of a microscopic perturbation this inability to predict long range conditions and sensitivity to initial conditions are characteristics of chaotic or complex systems i e the butterfly effect turbulent rayleigh b nard convection if the temperature of the bottom plane was to be further increased the structure would become more complex in space and time the turbulent flow would become chaotic convective b nard cells tend to approximate regular right hexagonal prisms particularly in the absence of turbulence although certain experimental conditions can result in the formation of regular right square prisms or spirals the convective b nard cells are not unique and will usually appear only in the surface tension driven convection in general the solutions to the rayleigh and pearson analysis linear theory assuming an infinite horizontal layer gives rise to degeneracy meaning that many patterns may be obtained by the system assuming uniform temperature at the top and bottom plates when a realistic system is used a layer with horizontal boundaries the shape of the boundaries will mandate the pattern more often than not the convection will appear as rolls or a superposition of them since there is a density gradient between the top and the bottom plate gravity acts trying to pull the cooler denser liquid from the top to the bottom this gravitational force is opposed by the viscous damping force in the fluid the balance of these two forces is expressed by a non dimensional parameter called the rayleigh number the rayleigh number is defined as where tu is the temperature of the top plate tb is the temperature of the bottom plate l is the height of the container g is the acceleration due to gravity is the kinematic viscosity is the thermal diffusivity is the thermal expansion coefficient as the rayleigh number increases the gravitational forces become more dominant at a critical rayleigh number of 1708 instability sets in and convection cells appear the critical rayleigh number can be obtained analytically for a number of different boundary conditions by doing a perturbation analysis on the linearized equations in the stable state the simplest case is that of two free boundaries which lord rayleigh solved in 1916 obtaining ra 4 657.51 in the case of a rigid boundary at the bottom and a free boundary at the top as in the case of a kettle without a lid the critical rayleigh number comes out as ra 1,100.65 main article marangoni effect in case of a free liquid surface in contact with air buoyancy and surface tension effects will also play a role in how the convection patterns develop liquids flow from places of lower surface tension to places of higher surface tension this is called the marangoni effect when applying heat from below the temperature at the top layer will show temperature fluctuations with increasing temperature surface tension decreases thus a lateral flow of liquid at the surface will take place from warmer areas to cooler areas in order to preserve a horizontal or nearly horizontal liquid surface cooler surface liquid will descend this down welling of cooler liquid contributes to the driving force of the convection cells the specific case of temperature gradient driven surface tension variations is known as thermo capillary convection or b nard marangoni convection rayleigh b nard convection whose effects are due solely to a temperature gradient was first successfully analyzed by lord rayleigh rayleigh assumed boundary conditions in which the vertical velocity component and temperature disturbance vanish at the top and bottom boundaries perfect thermal conduction those assumptions resulted in the analysis losing any connection with henri b nard s experiment this resulted in discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results until pearson reworked the problem based on surface tension this is what was originally observed by b nard nonetheless in modern usage rayleigh b nard convection refers to the effects due to temperature whereas b nard marangoni convection refers specifically to the effects of surface tension davis and koschmieder have suggested that the convection should be rightfully called the pearson b nard convection rayleigh b nard convection is also sometimes known as b nard rayleigh convection b
