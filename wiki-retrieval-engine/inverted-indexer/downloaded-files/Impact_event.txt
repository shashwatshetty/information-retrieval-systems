kilometers in diameter collides with a larger body such as the earth image artist s impression an impact event is a collision between astronomical objects causing measurable effects impact events have physical consequences and have been found to regularly occur in planetary systems though the most frequent involve asteroids comets or meteoroids and have minimal impact when large objects impact terrestrial planets like the earth there can be significant physical and biospheric consequences though atmospheres mitigate many surface impacts through atmospheric entry impact craters and structures are dominant landforms on many of the solar system s solid objects and present the strongest empirical evidence for their frequency and scale impact events appear to have played a significant role in the evolution of the solar system since its formation major impact events have significantly shaped earth s history have been implicated in the formation of the earth moon system the evolutionary history of life the origin of water on earth and several mass extinctions notable impact events include the chicxulub impact 66 million years ago believed to be the cause of the cretaceous paleogene extinction event throughout recorded history hundreds of earth impacts and exploding bolides have been reported with some occurrences causing deaths injuries property damage or other significant localised consequences one of the best known recorded impacts in modern times was the tunguska event which occurred in siberia russia in 1908 the 2013 chelyabinsk meteor event is the only known such incident in modern times to result in a large number of injuries excluding the 1490 ch ing yang event in china the chelyabinsk meteor is the largest recorded object to have encountered the earth since the tunguska event the asteroid impact that caused mistastin crater generated temperatures exceeding 2,370 c the highest temperatures known to have occurred on earth the comet shoemaker levy 9 impact provided the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects when the comet broke apart and collided with jupiter in july 1994 an extrasolar impact was observed in 2013 when a massive terrestrial planet impact was detected around the star id8 in the star cluster ngc 2547 by nasa s spitzer space telescope and confirmed by ground

chris stewart r ut and dr michael f a hearn 10 april 2013 united states congress frequency of small asteroids roughly 1 to 20 meters in diameter impacting earth s atmosphere a bolide undergoing atmospheric entry small objects frequently collide with earth there is an inverse relationship between the size of the object and the frequency of such events the lunar cratering record shows that the frequency of impacts decreases as approximately the cube of the resulting crater s diameter which is on average proportional to the diameter of the impactor asteroids with a 1 km 0.62 mi diameter strike earth every 500,000 years on average large collisions with 5 km 3 mi objects happen approximately once every twenty million years the last known impact of an object of 10 km 6 mi or more in diameter was at the cretaceous paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago the energy released by an impactor depends on diameter density velocity and angle the diameter of most near earth asteroids that have not been studied by radar or infrared can generally only be estimated within about a factor of 2 based on the asteroid brightness the density is generally assumed because the diameter and mass are also generally estimates the minimum impact velocity on earth is 11 km s with asteroid impacts averaging around 17 km s the most probable impact angle is 45 degrees stony asteroids with a diameter of 4 meters 13 ft enter earth s atmosphere approximately once per year asteroids with a diameter of 7 meters enter the atmosphere about every 5 years with as much kinetic energy as the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima approximately 16 kilotons of tnt but the air burst is reduced to just 5 kilotons these ordinarily explode in the upper atmosphere and most or all of the solids are vaporized however asteroids with a diameter of 20 m 66 ft and which strike earth approximately twice every century produce more powerful airbursts the 2013 chelyabinsk meteor was estimated to be about 20 m in diameter with an airburst of around 500 kilotons an explosion 30 times the one over hiroshima much larger objects may impact the solid earth and create a crater stony asteroid

meteorites an estimated 500 meteorites reach the surface each year but only 5 or 6 of these typically create a weather radar signature with a strewn field large enough to be recovered and be made known to scientists the late eugene shoemaker of the u s geological survey estimated the rate of earth impacts concluding that an event about the size of the nuclear weapon that destroyed hiroshima occurs about once a year such events would seem to be spectacularly obvious but they generally go unnoticed for a number of reasons the majority of the earth s surface is covered by water a good portion of the land surface is uninhabited and the explosions generally occur at relatively high altitude resulting in a huge flash and thunderclap but no real damage although no human is known to have been killed directly by an impact over 1000 people were injured by the chelyabinsk meteor airburst event over russia in 2013 in 2005 it was estimated that the chance of a single person born today dying due to an impact is around 1 in 200,000 the four meter sized asteroids and and suspected artificial satellite wt1190f are the only known objects to be detected before impacting the earth impacts have had during the history of the earth a significant geological and climatic influence the moon s existence is widely attributed to a huge impact early in earth s history impact events earlier in the history of earth have been credited with creative as well as destructive events it has been proposed that impacting comets delivered the earth s water and some have suggested that the origins of life may have been influenced by impacting objects by bringing organic chemicals or lifeforms to the earth s surface a theory known as exogenesis eugene merle shoemaker was first to prove that meteorite impacts have affected the earth these modified views of earth s history did not emerge until relatively recently chiefly due to a lack of direct observations and the difficulty in recognizing the signs of an earth impact because of erosion and weathering large scale terrestrial impacts of the sort that produced the barringer crater locally known as meteor crater northeast of flagstaff arizona are rare instead it was widely thought that cratering was the result of volcanism the barringer crater for example was ascribed to a prehistoric volcanic explosion not an unreasonable hypothesis given that the volcanic san francisco peaks stand only 30 miles 48 km to the west similarly the craters on the surface of the moon were ascribed to volcanism it was not until 1903 1905 that the barringer crater was correctly identified as an impact crater and it was not until as recently as 1963 that research by eugene merle shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis the findings of late 20th century space exploration and the work of scientists such as shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the solar system s solid bodies every surveyed solid body in the solar system was found to be cratered and there was no reason to believe that the earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space in the last few decades of the 20th century a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified the first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994 the collision of the comet shoemaker levy 9 with jupiter based on crater formation rates determined from the earth s closest celestial partner the moon astrogeologists have determined that during the last 600 million years the earth has been struck by 60 objects of a diameter of 5 km 3 mi or more the smallest of these impactors would leave a crater almost 100 km 60 mi across only three confirmed craters from that time period with that size or greater have been found chicxulub popigai and manicouagan and all three have been suspected of being linked to extinction events though only chicxulub the largest of the three has been consistently considered besides direct effect of asteroid impacts on a planet s surface topography global climate and life recent studies have shown that several consecutive impacts might have an effect on the dynamo mechanism at a planet s core responsible for maintaining the magnetic field of the planet and might eventually shut down the planet s magnetic field while numerous impact craters have been confirmed on land or in the shallow seas over continental shelves no impact craters in the deep ocean have been widely accepted by the scientific community impacts of projectiles as large as one km in diameter are generally thought to explode before reaching the sea floor but it is unknown what would happen if a much larger impactor struck the deep ocean the lack of a crater however does not mean that an ocean impact would not have dangerous implications for humanity some scholars have argued that an impact event in an ocean or sea may create a megatsunami a giant wave which can cause destruction both at sea and on land along the coast but this is disputed an example of an ocean impact is the large but apparently craterless eltanin impact into the pacific ocean in 2.5 ma and is thought to involve an object about 1 to 4 kilometres 0.62 to 2.49 mi across an impact event may cause a mantle plume volcanism at the antipodal point of the impact the effect of impact events on the biosphere has been the subject of scientific debate several theories of impact related mass extinction have been developed in the past 500 million years there have been five generally accepted major mass extinctions that on average extinguished half of all species one of the largest mass extinctions to have affected life on earth was the permian triassic which ended the permian period 250 million years ago and killed off 90 percent of all species life on earth took 30 million years to recover the cause of the permian triassic extinction is still a matter of debate the age and origin of proposed impact craters i e the bedout high structure hypothesized to be associated with it are still controversial the last such mass extinction led to the demise of the dinosaurs and coincided with a large meteorite impact this is the cretaceous paleogene extinction event also known as the k t or k pg extinction event which occurred 66 million years ago there is no definitive evidence of impacts leading to the three other major mass extinctions in 1980 physicist luis alvarez his son geologist walter alvarez and nuclear chemists frank asaro and helen v michael from the university of california berkeley discovered unusually high concentrations of iridium in a specific layer of rock strata in the earth s crust iridium is an element that is rare on earth but relatively abundant in many meteorites from the amount and distribution of iridium present in the 65 million year old iridium layer the alvarez team later estimated that an asteroid of 10 to 14 km 6 to 9 mi must have collided with the earth this iridium layer at the cretaceous paleogene boundary has been found worldwide at 100 different sites multidirectionally shocked quartz coesite which is normally associated with large impact events or atomic bomb explosions has also been found in the same layer at more than 30 sites soot and ash at levels tens of thousands times normal levels were found with the above anomalies in chromium isotopic ratios found within the k t boundary layer strongly support the impact theory chromium isotopic ratios are homogeneous within the earth and therefore these isotopic anomalies exclude a volcanic origin which has also been proposed as a cause for the iridium enrichment further the chromium isotopic ratios measured in the k t boundary are similar to the chromium isotopic ratios found in carbonaceous chondrites thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid but also a comet is possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites probably the most convincing evidence for a worldwide catastrophe was the discovery of the crater which has since been named chicxulub crater this crater is centered on the yucat n peninsula of mexico and was discovered by tony camargo and glen pentfield while working as geophysicists for the mexican oil company pemex what they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be 180 km 110 mi in diameter this convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extraterrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period although there is now general agreement that there was a huge impact at the end of the cretaceous that led to the iridium enrichment of the k t boundary layer remnants have been found of other smaller impacts some nearing half the size of the chicxulub crater which did not result in any mass extinctions and there is no clear linkage between an impact and any other incident of mass extinction paleontologists david m raup and jack sepkoski have proposed that an excess of extinction events occurs roughly every 26 million years though many are relatively minor this led physicist richard a muller to suggest that these extinctions could be due to a hypothetical companion star to the sun called nemesis periodically disrupting the orbits of comets in the oort cloud leading to a large increase in the number of comets reaching the inner solar system where they might hit earth physicist adrian melott and paleontologist richard bambach have more recently verified the raup and sepkoski finding but argue that it is not consistent with the characteristics expected of a nemesis style periodicity main article end of civilization an impact event is commonly seen as a scenario that would bring about the end of civilization in 2000 discover magazine published a list of 20 possible sudden doomsday scenarios with an impact event listed as the most likely to occur a joint pew research center smithsonian survey from april 21 26 2010 found that 31 percent of americans believed that an asteroid will collide with earth by 2050 a majority 61 percent disagreed artist s depiction of a collision between two planetary bodies such an impact between the earth and a mars sized object likely formed the moon in the early history of the earth about four billion years ago bolide impacts were almost certainly common since the solar system contained far more discrete bodies than at present such impacts could have included strikes by asteroids hundreds of kilometers in diameter with explosions so powerful that they vaporized all the earth s oceans it was not until this heavy bombardment slackened that life appears to have begun to evolve on earth the leading theory of the moon s origin is the giant impact theory which postulates that earth was once hit by a planetoid the size of mars such a theory is able to explain the size and composition of the moon something not done by other theories of lunar formation evidence of a massive impact in south africa near a geological formation known as the barberton greenstone belt was uncovered by scientists in april 2014 they estimated the impact occurred about 3.26 billion years ago and that the impactor was approximately 37 58 kilometers 23 36 miles wide the crater from this event if it still exists has not yet been found two 10 kilometre sized asteroids are now believed to have struck australia between 360 and 300 million years ago at the western warburton and east warburton basins creating a 400 kilometre impact zone according to evidence found in 2015 it is the largest ever recorded a third possible impact was also identified in 2015 to the north on the upper diamantina river also believed to have been caused by an asteroid 10 km across about 300 million years ago but further studies are needed to establish that this crustal anomaly was indeed the result of an impact event further information pleistocene aerial view of barringer crater in arizona artifacts recovered with tektites from the 803,000 year old australasian strewnfield event in asia link a homo erectus population to a significant meteorite impact and its aftermath significant examples of pleistocene impacts include the lonar crater lake in india approximately 52,000 years old though a study published in 2010 gives a much greater age which now has a flourishing semi tropical jungle around it further information holocene the rio cuarto craters in argentina were produced approximately 10,000 years ago at the beginning of the holocene if proved to be impact craters they would be the first impact of the holocene the campo del cielo field of heaven refers to an area bordering argentina s chaco province where a group of iron meteorites were found estimated as dating to 4,000 5,000 years ago it first came to attention of spanish authorities in 1576 in 2015 police arrested four alleged smugglers trying to steal more than a ton of protected meteorites the henbury craters in australia 5,000 years old and kaali craters in estonia 2,700 years old were apparently produced by objects that broke up before impact whitecourt crater in alberta canada is estimated to be between 1,080 and 1,130 years old the crater is approximately 36 m 118 ft in diameter and 9 m 30 ft deep is heavily forested and was discovered in 2007 when a metal detector revealed fragments of meteoric iron scattered around the area a chinese record states that 10,000 people were killed in the 1490 ch ing yang event with the deaths caused by a hail of falling stones some astronomers hypothesize that this may describe an actual meteorite fall although they find the number of deaths implausible kamil crater discovered from google earth image review in egypt 45 m 148 ft

image of the east uweinat desert egypt trees knocked over by the tunguska blast one of the best known recorded impacts in modern times was the tunguska event which occurred in siberia russia in 1908 this incident involved an explosion that was probably caused by the airburst of an asteroid or comet 5 to 10 km 3.1 to 6.2 mi above the earth s surface felling an estimated 80 million trees over 2,150 km2 830 sq mi in february 1947 another large bolide impacted the earth in the sikhote alin mountains primorye soviet union it was during daytime so was witnessed by many people which allowed v g fesenkov then chairman of the meteorite committee of the ussr academy of science to estimate the meteoroid s orbit before it encountered the earth sikhote alin is a massive fall with the overall size of the meteoroid estimated at approximately 90,000 kg 200,000 lb a more recent estimate by tsvetkov and others puts the mass at around 100,000 kg 220,000 lb it was an iron meteorite belonging to the chemical group iiab and with a coarse octahedrite structure more than 70 tonnes metric tons of material survived the collision a case of a human injured by a space rock occurred on november 30 1954 in sylacauga alabama there a 4 kg 8.8 lb stone chondrite crashed through a roof and hit ann hodges in her living room after it bounced off her radio she was badly bruised by the fragments several persons have since claimed to have been struck by meteorites but no verifiable meteorites have resulted a small number of meteor falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point the first of these was the pribram meteorite which fell in czechoslovakia now the czech republic in 1959 in this case two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball the images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and more significantly to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite following the pribram fall other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites one of these was the prairie network operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory from 1963 to 1975 in the midwestern us this program also observed a meteorite fall the lost city chondrite allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit another program in canada the meteorite observation and recovery project ran from 1971 to 1985 it too recovered a single meteorite innisfree in 1977 finally observations by the european fireball network a descendant of the original czech program that recovered pribram led to the discovery and orbit calculations for the neuschwanstein meteorite in 2002 on august 10 1972 a meteor which became known as the 1972 great daylight fireball was witnessed by many people as it moved north over the rocky mountains from the u s southwest to canada it was filmed by a tourist at the grand teton national park in wyoming with an 8 millimeter color movie camera the object was in the range of size from a car to a house and could have ended its life in a hiroshima sized blast but there was never any explosion analysis of the trajectory indicated that it never came much lower than 58 km 36 mi off the ground and the conclusion was that it had grazed earth s atmosphere for about 100 seconds then skipped back out of the atmosphere to return to its orbit around the sun many impact events occur without being observed by anyone on the ground between 1975 and 1992 american missile early warning satellites picked up 136 major explosions in the upper atmosphere in the november 21 2002 edition of the journal nature peter brown of the university of western ontario reported on his study of us early warning satellite records for the preceding eight years he identified 300 flashes caused by 1 to 10 m 3 to 33 ft meteors in that time period and estimated the rate of tunguska sized events as once in 400 years eugene shoemaker estimated that an event of such magnitude occurs about once every 300 years though more recent analyses have suggested he exaggerated by an order of magnitude in the dark morning hours of january 18 2000 a fireball exploded over the city of whitehorse yukon territory at an altitude of about 26 km 16 mi lighting up the night like day the meteor that produced the fireball was estimated to be about 4.6 m 15 ft in diameter with a weight of 180 tonnes this blast was also featured on the science channel series killer asteroids with several witness reports from residents in atlin british columbia on 7 june 2006 a meteor was observed striking reisadalen in nordreisa municipality in troms county norway although initial witness reports stated that the resultant fireball was equivalent to the hiroshima nuclear explosion scientific analysis places the force of the blast at anywhere from 100 500 tonnes tnt equivalent around three percent of hiroshima s yield on 15 september 2007 a chondritic meteor crashed near the village of carancas in southeastern peru near lake titicaca leaving a water filled hole and spewing gases across the surrounding area many residents became ill apparently from the noxious gases shortly after the impact on 7 october 2008 a meteoroid labeled was tracked for 20 hours as it approached earth and as it fell through the atmosphere and impacted in sudan this was the first time an object was detected before it reached the atmosphere and hundreds of pieces of the meteorite were recovered from the nubian desert trail left by the exploding chelyabinsk meteor as it passed over the city on 15 february 2013 an asteroid entered earth s atmosphere over russia as a fireball and exploded above the city of chelyabinsk during its passage through the ural mountains region at 09 13 yekt 03 13 utc the object s air burst occurred at an altitude between 30 and 50 km 19 and 31 mi above the ground and about 1,500 people were injured mainly by broken window glass shattered by the shock wave two were reported in serious condition however there were no fatalities initially some 3,000 buildings in six cities across the region were reported damaged due to the explosion s shock wave a figure which rose to over 7,200 in the following weeks the chelyabinsk meteor was estimated to have caused over 30 million in damage it is the largest recorded object to have encountered the earth since the 1908 tunguska event the meteor is estimated to have an initial diameter of 17 20 metres and a mass of roughly 10,000 tonnes on 16 october 2013 a team from ural federal university led by victor grokhovsky recovered a large fragment of the meteor from the bottom of russia s lake chebarkul about 80 km west of the city on 1 january 2014 a 3 meter 10 foot asteroid 2014 aa was discovered by the mount lemmon survey and observed over the next hour and was soon found to be on a collision course with earth the exact location was uncertain constrained to a line between panama the central atlantic ocean the gambia and ethiopia around roughly the time expected 2 january 3 06 utc an infrasound burst was detected near the center of the impact range in the middle of the atlantic ocean this marks the second time a natural object was identified prior to impacting earth after 2008 tc3 nearly two years later on october 3 wt1190f was detected orbiting earth on a highly eccentric orbit taking it from well within the geocentric satellite ring to nearly twice the orbit of the moon it was estimated to be perturbed by the moon onto a collision course with earth on november 13 with over a month of observations as well as precovery observations found dating back to 2009 it was found to be far less dense than a natural asteroid should be suggesting that it was most likely an unidentified artificial satellite as predicted it fell over sri lanka at 6 18 utc 11 48 local time the sky in the region was very overcast so only an airborne observation team was able to successfully observe it falling above the clouds it is now thought to be a remnant of the lunar prospector mission in 1998 and is the third time any previously unknown object natural or artificial was identified prior to impact on 22 january 2018 an object a106fgf was discovered by the asteroid terrestrial impact last alert system and identified as possibly impacting earth later that day while a very close approach to earth was not ruled out entirely the odds of impact were fairly likely as it was very dim and only identified hours before its approach no more than the initial 4 observations covering a 39 minute period were made of the object it is unknown if it impacted earth or not but no fireball was detected in either infrared or infrasound so if it did it would have been very small and likely near the eastern end of its potential impact area in the western pacific ocean main article list of largest craters in the solar system topographical

comet that broke apart and collided with jupiter providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects the event served as a wake up call and astronomers responded by starting programs such as lincoln near earth asteroid research linear near earth asteroid tracking neat lowell observatory near earth object search loneos and several others which have drastically increased the rate of asteroid discovery the 2009 jupiter impact event happened on july 19 when a new black spot about the size of earth was discovered in jupiter s southern hemisphere by

reconnaissance orbiter provide compelling evidence of the largest impact observed to date on mars in the form of fresh craters the largest measuring 48.5 by 43.5 meters it is estimated to be caused by an impactor 3 to 5 meters long on march 19 2013 an impact occurred on the moon that was visible from earth when a boulder sized 30 cm meteoroid slammed into the lunar surface at 90,000 km h 56,000 mph creating a 20 meter crater nasa has actively monitored lunar impacts since 2005 tracking hundreds of candidate events asteroid collision led to the building of planets near star ngc 2547 id8 artist concept collisions between galaxies or galaxy mergers have been observed directly by space telescopes such as hubble and spitzer however collisions in planetary systems including stellar collisions while long speculated have only recently begun to be observed directly in 2013 an impact between minor planets was detected around the star ngc 2547 by spitzer and confirmed by ground observations computer modelling suggests that the impact involved large asteroids or protoplanets similar to the events believed to have led to the formation of terrestrial planets like the earth main article asteroids in fiction collisions with planets numerous science fiction stories and novels center around an impact event one of the first and more popular is off on a comet french by jules verne published in 1877 and h g wells wrote about such an event in his 1897 short story the star in more modern times possibly the best selling was the novel lucifer s hammer by larry niven and jerry pournelle arthur c clarke s novel rendezvous with rama opens with a significant asteroid impact in northern italy in the year 2077 which gives rise to the spaceguard project which later discovers the rama spacecraft in 1992 a congressional study in the u s led to nasa being directed to undertake the spaceguard survey with the novel being named as the inspiration for the name to search for earth impacting asteroids this in turn inspired clarke s 1993 novel the hammer of god a variation on the traditional impact story was provided by jack mcdevitt s 1999 novel moonfall in which a very large comet traveling at interstellar velocities collides with and partially destroys the moon fragments of which then collide with the earth the 1985 niven and pournelle novel footfall features the examination of the effects of planetary warfare conducted by an alien species that culminates in the use of asteroids to bombard the planet creating very large craters and the human species near extinction robert a heinlein used the concept of guided meteors in his novel the moon is a harsh mistress in which moon rebels use rock filled shipping containers as a weapon against their earth oppressors some science fiction has concerned itself not with the specifics of the impact event and or its prevention or avoidance but its secondary effects on human society ben h winters 2012 novel the last policeman is set six months prior to an asteroid collision following a murder investigation that is complicated by the political and cultural responses to the impending event see also asteroid impact avoidance fictional representations several disaster films center on actual or threatened impact events released during the turbulence of world war i the danish feature film the end of the world revolves around the near miss of a comet which causes fire showers and social unrest in europe when worlds collide 1951 based on a 1933 novel by philip wylie deals with two planets on a collision course with earth the smaller planet a near miss causing extensive damage and destruction followed by a direct hit from the larger planet meteor 1979 features small asteroid fragments and a large 8 km 5 mi wide asteroid heading for earth after being wrenched out of orbit by a collision with a comet orbiting u s and soviet nuclear weapons platforms are turned away from their respective earthbound targets and toward the incoming threat the concept for this defense mechanism was taken from a 1968 mit study called project icarus in 1998 two films were released in the united states on the subject of attempting to stop impact events paramount dreamworks deep impact about a comet and touchstone pictures armageddon about an asteroid both involved using space shuttle derived craft to deliver nuclear weapons to destroy their targets the 2008 american broadcasting company s miniseries impact deals with a splinter of a brown dwarf hidden in a meteor shower which strikes the moon and sends it on a collision course with earth the 2011 film melancholia uses the motif of an impact event incorporated in the aesthetics of romanticism asteroid capture asteroid impact avoidance b612
