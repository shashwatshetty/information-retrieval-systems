has long existed at a crossroads of cultures with a strategic location in terms of trade on the west of the arabian peninsula large settlements for their era existed in the mountains of northern yemen as early as 5000 bc the sabaean kingdom came into existence from at least the 11th century bc the four major kingdoms or tribal confederations in south arabia were saba hadramout qataban and ma in saba arabic is thought to be biblical sheba and was the most prominent federation the sabaean rulers adopted the title mukarrib generally thought to mean unifier or a priest king or the head of confederation of south arabian kingdoms the king of the kings the role of the mukarrib was to bring the various tribes under the kingdom and preside over them all the sabaens built the great dam of marib around 940 bc the dam was built to withstand the seasonal flash floods surging down the valley between 700 and 680 bc the kingdom of awsan dominated aden and its surroundings and challenged the sabaean supremacy in the arabian south sabaean mukarrib karib il watar i conquered the entire realm of awsan and expanded sabaean rule and territory to include much of south arabia lack of water in the arabian peninsula prevented the sabaeans from unifying the entire peninsula instead they established various colonies to control trade routes evidence of sabaean influence is found in northern ethiopia where the south arabian alphabet religion and pantheon and the south arabian style of art and architecture were introduced the sabaean created a sense of identity through their religion they worshipped el maqah and believed that they were his children for centuries the sabaeans controlled outbound trade across the bab el mandeb a strait separating the arabian peninsula from the horn of africa and the red sea from the indian ocean by the third century bc qataban hadramout and ma in became independent from saba and established themselves in the yemeni arena minaean rule stretched as far as dedan with their capital at baraqish the sabaeans regained their control over ma in after the collapse of qataban in 50 bce by the time of the roman expedition to arabia felix in 25 bc the sabaeans were once again the dominating power in southern arabia aelius gallus was ordered to lead a military campaign to establish roman dominance over the sabaeans the romans had a vague and contradictory geographical knowledge about arabia felix or yemen the roman army of 10,000 men was defeated before marib strabo s close relationship with aelius gallus led him to attempt to justify his friend s defeat in his writings it took the romans six months to reach marib and 60 days to return to egypt the romans blamed their nabataean guide and executed him for treachery no direct mention in sabaean inscriptions of the roman expedition has yet been found after the roman expedition perhaps earlier the country fell into chaos and two clans namely hamdan and himyar claimed kingship assuming

inscriptions led a military campaign to central arabia or najd to support the vassal kingdom of kindah against the lakhmids however no direct reference to judaism or yathrib was discovered from his lengthy reign abu kariba died in 445 ce having reigned for almost 50 years by 515 ad himyar became increasingly divided along religious lines and a bitter conflict between different factions paved the way for an aksumite intervention the last himyarite king ma adikarib ya fur was supported by aksum against his jewish rivals ma adikarib was christian and launched a campaign against the lakhmids in southern iraq with the support of other arab allies of byzantium the lakhmids were a bulwark of persia which was intolerant to a proselytizing religion like christianity after the death of ma adikarib ya fur around 521 ce a himyarite jewish warlord named yousef asar yathar rose to power with the honorary title of yathar meaning to avenge yemenite christians aided by aksum and byzantium systematically persecuted jews and burned down several synagogues across the land yousef avenged his people with great cruelty he marched toward the port city of mocha killing 14,000 and capturing 11,000 then he settled a camp in bab el mandeb to prevent aid flowing from aksum at the same time yousef sent an army under the command of another jewish warlord sharahil yaqbul to najran sharahil had reinforcements from the bedouins of the kindah and madh hij tribes eventually wiping out the christian community in najran yousef or dhu nuwas the one with sidelocks as known in arabic literature believed that christians in yemen were a fifth column christian sources portray dhu nuwas yousef asar as a jewish zealot while islamic traditions say that he threw 20,000 christians into pits filled with flaming oil this history however is shrouded in legend dhu nuwas left two inscriptions neither of them making any reference to fiery pits byzantium had to act or lose all credibility as protector of eastern christianity it is reported that byzantium emperor justin i sent a letter to the aksumite king kaleb pressuring him to attack the abominable hebrew a tripartite military alliance of byzantine aksumite and arab christians successfully defeated yousef around 525 527 ce and a client christian king was installed on the himyarite throne esimiphaios was a local christian lord mentioned in an inscription celebrating the burning of an ancient sabaean palace in marib to build a church on its ruins three new churches were built in najran alone many tribes did not recognize esimiphaios s authority esimiphaios was displaced in 531 by a warrior named abraha who refused to leave yemen and declared himself an independent king of himyar emperor justinian i sent an embassy to yemen he wanted the officially christian himyarites to use their influence on the tribes in inner arabia to launch military operations against persia justinian i bestowed the dignity of king upon the arab sheikhs of kindah and ghassan in central and northern arabia from early on roman and byzantine policy was to develop close links with the powers of the coast of the red sea they were successful in converting aksum and influencing their culture the results with regard to yemen were rather disappointing a kendite prince called yazid bin kabshat rebelled against abraha and his arab christian allies a truce was reached once the great dam of marib had suffered a breach abraha died around 555 565 no reliable sources regarding his death are available the sasanid empire annexed aden around 570

the rasulid state nurtured yemen s commercial links with india and the far east they profited greatly by the red sea transit trade via aden and zabid the economy also boomed due to the agricultural development programs instituted by the kings who promoted massive cultivation of palms the rasulid kings enjoyed the support of the population of tihama and southern yemen while they had to buy the loyalty of yemen s restive northern highland tribes the rasulid sultans built numerous madrasas to solidify the shafi i school of thought which is still the dominant school of jurisprudence amongst yemenis today under their rule taiz and zabid became major international centers of islamic learning the kings themselves were learned men in their own right who not only had important libraries but who also wrote treatises on a wide array of subjects ranging from astrology and medicine to agriculture and genealogy the dynasty is regarded as the greatest native yemeni state since the fall of pre islamic himyarite kingdom they were of turkic descent they claimed an ancient yemenite origin to justify their rule the rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes nor were they doing anything out of the ordinary in the tribal context of arabia by claiming descent from a solid yemenite tribe the rasulids brought yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu they had a difficult relationship with the mamluks of egypt because the latter considered them a vassal state their competition centered over the hejaz and the right to provide kiswa of the ka aba in mecca the dynasty became increasingly threatened by disgruntled family members over the problem of succession combined by periodic tribal revolts as they were locked in a war of attrition with the zaydi imams in the northern highlands during the last 12 years of rasulid rule the country was torn between several contenders for the kingdom the weakening of the rasulid provided an opportunity for the banu taher clan to take over and establish themselves as the new rulers of yemen in 1454 ce main article tahirids yemen the tahirids were a local clan based in rada a while they were not as impressive as their predecessors they were still keen builders they built schools mosques and irrigation channels as well as water cisterns and bridges in zabid aden rada a and juban their best known monument is the amiriya madrasa in rada district which was built in 1504 the tahiride were too weak either to contain the zaydi imams or to defend themselves against foreign attacks the mamluks of egypt tried to attach yemen to egypt and the portuguese led by afonso de albuquerque occupied socotra and made an unsuccessful attack on aden in 1513 the portuguese posed an immediate threat to the indian ocean trade the mamluks of egypt therefore sent an army under the command of hussein al kurdi to fight the intruders the mamluk sultan of egypt sailed to zabid in 1515 and began diplomatic talks with tahiride sultan amir bin abdulwahab for money that would be needed for jih d arabic struggle against the portuguese instead of confronting the portuguese the mamluks who were running out of food and water landed their fleet on the yemen coastline and started to harass tihama villagers for what they needed realizing how rich the tahiride realm was they

conquer yemen the country was in a state of incessant anarchy and discord as had m suleiman pasha described it by saying yemen is a land with no lord an empty province it would be not only possible but easy to capture and should it be captured it would be master of the lands of india and send every year a great amount of gold and jewels to constantinople imam al mutawakkil yahya sharaf ad din ruled over the northern highlands including sana a while aden was held by the last tahiride sultan amir ibn dauod had m suleiman pasha stormed aden in 1538 killing its ruler and extended ottoman

highlands they held sway mainly in the southern coastal region particularly around zabid mocha and aden of 80,000 soldiers sent to yemen from egypt between 1539 and 1547 only 7,000 survived the ottoman accountant general in egypt remarked we have seen no foundry like yemen for our soldiers each time we have sent an expeditionary force there it has melted away like salt dissolved in water the ottomans sent yet another expeditionary force to zabid in 1547 while imam al mutawakkil yahya sharaf ad din was ruling the highlands independently imam al mutawakkil yahya chose his son ali to succeed him a decision that infuriated his other son al mutahhar ibn yahya al mutahhar was lame so was not qualified for the imamate he urged oais pasha the ottoman colonial governor in zabid to attack his father indeed ottoman troops supported by tribal forces loyal to imam al mutahhar stormed taiz and marched north toward sana a in august 1547 the turks officially made imam al mutahhar a sanjak bey with authority over amran imam al mutahhar assassinated the ottoman colonial governor and recaptured sana a but the ottomans led by zdemir pasha forced al mutahhar to retreat to his fortress in thula zdemir pasha effectively put yemen under ottoman rule between 1552 and 1560 he was considered a competent ruler given yemen s notorious lawlessness garrisoning the main cities building new fortresses and rendering secure the main routes zdemir died in sana a in 1561 and was succeeded by mahmud pasha unlike zdemir s brief but able leadership mahmud pasha was described by other ottoman officials as a corrupt and unscrupulous governor he used his authority to take over a number of castles some of which belonged to the former rasulid kings mahmud pasha killed a sunni scholar from ibb the ottoman historian claimed that this incident was celebrated by the zaydi shia community in the northern highlands disregarding the delicate balance of power in yemen by acting tactlessly he alienated different groups within yemeni society causing them to forget their rivalries and unite against the turks mahmud pasha was displaced by ridvan pasha in 1564 by 1565 yemen was split into two provinces the highlands under the command of ridvan pasha and tihama under murad pasha imam al mutahhar launched a propaganda campaign in which he claimed that prophet mohammed came to him in a dream and advised him to wage jihad against the ottomans al mutahhar led the tribes to capture sana a from ridvan pasha in 1567 when murad tried to relieve sana a highland tribesmen ambushed his unit and slaughtered all of them over 80 battles were fought the last decisive encounter took place in dhamar around 1568 in which murad pasha was beheaded and his head sent to al mutahhar in sana a by 1568 only zabid remained under the possession of the turks ruins of thula fortress in amran where al mutahhar ibn yahya barricaded himself against ottoman attacks lala kara mustafa pasha the ottoman governor of syria was ordered by selim ii to suppress the yemeni rebels however the turkish army in egypt was reluctant to go to yemen due to their knowledge of the hegemony of the northern yemenis mustafa pasha sent a letter with two turkish shawishes hoping to persuade al mutahhar to give an apology and confirm that mustafa pasha did not promote any act of aggression against the ottoman army and state that the ignorant arabian according to the turks acted on their own imam al mutahhar refused the ottoman offer when mustafa pasha sent an expeditionary force under the command of uthman pasha it was defeated with great casualties sultan selim ii was infuriated by mustafa s hesitation to go yemen he executed a number of sanjak beys in egypt and ordered sinan pasha to lead the entire turkish army in egypt to reconquer yemen sinan pasha was a prominent ottoman general of albanian origin he reconquered aden taiz and ibb and besieged shibam kawkaban in 1570 for 7 months the siege was lifted once a truce was reached imam al mutahhar was pushed back but could not be entirely overcome after al mutahhar s demise in 1572 the zaydi community was not united under an imam the turks took advantage of their disunity and conquered sana a sa dah and najran in 1583 imam al nasir hassan was arrested in 1585 and exiled to constantinople thereby putting an end to the yemeni rebellion the zaydi tribesmen in the northern highlands particularly those of hashid and bakil were ever the turkish bugbear in all arabia the ottomans who justified their presence in yemen as a triumph for islam accused the zaydis of being infidels hassan pasha was appointed governor of yemen and enjoyed a period of relative peace from 1585 to 1597 pupils of al mansur al qasim suggested he should claim the

september 1597 which was the same year the ottoman authorities inaugurated al bakiriyya mosque by 1608 imam al mansur the victorious regained control over the highlands and signed a truce for 10 years with the ottomans imam al mansur al qasim died in 1620 his son al mu ayyad muhammad succeeded him and confirmed the truce with the ottomans in 1627 the ottomans lost aden and lahej abdin pasha was ordered to suppress the rebels but failed and had to retreat to mocha al mu ayyad muhammad expelled the ottomans from sana a in 1628 only zabid and mocha remained under ottoman possession al mu ayyad muhammad captured zabid in 1634 and allowed the ottomans to leave mocha peacefully the reason behind al mu ayyad muhammad s success was the possession of firearms by the tribes and their unity behind him mocha was yemen s busiest port in the 17th and 18th centuries in 1632 al mu ayyad muhammad sent an expeditionary force of 1000 men to conquer mecca the army entered the city in triumph and killed its governor the ottomans were not ready to lose mecca after yemen so they sent an army from egypt to fight the yemenites seeing that the turkish army was too numerous to overcome the yemeni army retreated to a valley outside mecca ottoman troops attacked the yemenis by hiding at the wells that supplied them with water this plan proceeded successfully causing the yemenis over 200 casualties most from thirst the tribesmen eventually surrendered and returned to yemen al mu ayyad muhammad died in 1644 he was succeeded by al mutawakkil isma il another son of al mansur al qasim who conquered yemen in its entirety from asir in the north to dhofar in the east during his reign and during the reign of his successor al mahdi ahmad 1676 1681 the imamate implemented some of the harshest discriminatory laws ghiyar against the jews of yemen which culminated in the expulsion of all jews exile of mawza to a hot and arid region in the tihama coastal plain the qasimid state was the strongest zaydi state to ever exist during that period yemen was the sole coffee producer in the world the country established diplomatic relations with the safavid dynasty of persia ottomans of hejaz mughal empire in india and ethiopia as well fasilides of ethiopia sent three diplomatic missions to yemen but the relations did not develop into political alliance as fasilides had hoped due to the rise of powerful feudalists in his country in the first half of the 18th century the europeans broke yemen s monopoly on coffee by smuggling coffee trees and cultivating them in their own colonies in the east indies east africa the west indies and latin america the imamate did not follow a cohesive mechanism for succession and family quarrels and tribal insubordination led to the political decline of the qasimi dynasty in the 18th century in 1728 or 1731 the chief representative of lahej declared himself an independent sultan in defiance of the qasimid dynasty and conquered aden thus establishing the sultanate of lahej the rising power of the fervently islamist wahhabi movement on the arabian peninsula cost the zaidi state its coastal possessions after 1803 the imam was able to regain them temporarily in 1818 but new intervention by the ottoman viceroy of egypt in 1833 again wrested the coast from the ruler in sana a after 1835 the imamate changed hands with great frequency

india company officials decided on aden the british empire tried to reach an agreement with the zaydi imam of sana a permitting them a foothold in mocha and when unable to secure their position they extracted a similar agreement from the sultan of lahej enabling them to consolidate a position in aden an incident played into british hands when while passing aden for trading purposes one of their sailing ships sank and arab tribesmen boarded it and plundered its contents the british india government dispatched a warship under the command of captain stafford bettesworth haines to demand compensation haines bombarded aden from his warship in january 1839 the ruler of lahej who was in aden at the time ordered his guards to defend the port but they failed in the face of overwhelming military and naval power the british managed to occupy aden and agreed to compensate the sultan with an annual payment of 6000 riyals the british evicted the sultan of lahej from aden and forced him to accept their protection in november 1839 5000 tribesmen tried to retake the town but were repulsed and 200 were killed the british realised that aden s prosperity depended on their relations with the neighbouring tribes which required that they rest on a firm and satisfactory basis the british government concluded protection and friendship treaties with nine tribes surrounding aden whereas

to other sects some citizens of sana a were desperate to return law and order to yemen and asked the ottoman pasha in tihama to pacify the country yemeni merchants knew that the return of the ottomans would improve their trade for the ottomans would become their customers an ottoman expedition force tried to capture sana a but was defeated and had to evacuate the highlands the opening of the suez canal in 1869 strengthened the ottoman decision to remain in yemen in 1872 military forces were dispatched from constantinople and moved beyond the ottoman stronghold in the lowlands tihama to conquer sana a by 1873 the ottomans succeeded in conquering the northern highlands sana a became the administrative capital of yemen vilayet the ottomans learned from their previous experience and worked on the disempowerment of local lords in the highland regions they even attempted to secularize the yemeni society while yemenite jews came to perceive themselves in yemeni nationalist terms the ottomans appeased the tribes by forgiving their rebellious chiefs and appointing them to administrative posts they introduced a series of reforms to enhance the country s economic welfare however corruption was widespread in the ottoman administration in yemen this was because only the worst of the officials were appointed because those who could avoid serving in yemen did so the ottomans had reasserted control over the highlands for temporary duration the so called tanzimat reforms were considered heretic by the zaydi tribes in 1876 the hashid and bakil tribes rebelled against the ottomans the turks had to appease them with gifts to end the uprising the tribal chiefs were difficult to appease and an endless cycle of violence curbed ottoman efforts to pacify the land ahmed izzet pasha proposed that the ottoman army evacuate the highlands and confine itself to tihama and not unnecessarily burden itself with continuing military operation against the zaydi tribes the hit and run tactics of the northern highlands tribesmen wore out the ottoman military they resented the turkish tanzimat and defied all attempts to impose a central government upon them the northern tribes united under the leadership of the house of hamidaddin in 1890 imam yahya hamidaddin led a rebellion against the turks in 1904 the rebels disrupted the ottoman ability to govern the revolts between 1904 and 1911 were especially damaging to the ottomans costing them as many as 10,000 soldiers and as much as 500,000 pounds per year the ottomans signed a treaty with imam yahya hamidaddin in 1911 under the treaty imam

kingdom of yemen imam yahya hamid ed din s house in sana a imam yahya hamid ed din al mutawakkil was ruling the northern highlands independently from 1911 after the ottoman departure in 1918 he sought to recapture the lands of his qasimid ancestors he dreamed of greater yemen stretching from asir to dhofar these schemes brought him into conflict with the de facto rulers in the territories claimed namely the idrsids ibn saud and the british government in aden the zaydi imam did not recognize the anglo ottoman border agreement of 1905 on the grounds that it was made between two foreign powers occupying yemen the border treaty effectively divided yemen into north and south in 1915 the british signed a treaty with the idrsids guaranteeing their security and independence if they would fight against the turks in 1919 imam yahya hamid ed din moved southward to liberate the nine british protectorates the british responded by moving quickly towards tihama and occupying al hudaydah then they handed it over to their idrisi allies imam yahya attacked the southern protectorates again in 1922 the british bombed yahya s tribal forces using aircraft to which the tribes had no effective counter in 1925 imam yahya captured al hudaydah from the idrsids he continued to follow and attack the idrsids until asir fell under the control of the imam s forces forcing the idrisi to request an agreement that would enable them to administer the region in the name of the imam imam yahya refused the offer on the grounds that the idrisis were of a moroccan descent according to imam yahya the idrisis along with the british were nothing but recent intruders and should be driven out of yemen permanently in 1927 imam yahya s forces were 50 km away from aden taiz and ibb and were bombed by the british for five days the imam had to pull back small bedouin forces mainly from the madh hij confederation of marib attacked shabwah but were bombed by the british and had to retreat the italian empire was the first to recognize imam yahya as the king of yemen in 1926 this created a great deal of anxiety for the british who interpreted it as recognition of imam yahya s claim to sovereignty over greater yemen which included the aden protectorate and asir the idrisis turned to ibn saud seeking his protection from yahya muhammad hamid ed din however in 1932 the idrisis broke their accord with ibn saud and went back to imam yahya seeking help against ibn saud himself who had begun liquidating their authority and expressed his desire to annex those territories into his own saudi domain imam yahya demanded the return of all idrisi dominion that same year a group of hejazi liberals fled to yemen and plotted to expel ibn saud from the former hashemite kingdom of hejaz which had been conquered by the saudis seven years earlier ibn saud appealed to britain for aid the british government sent arms and aeroplanes the british were anxious that ibn saud s financial difficulties may encourage the italian empire to bail him out ibn saud suppressed the asiri rebellion in 1933 after which the idrsids fled to sana a negotiations between the imam yahya hamid ed din and ibn saud proved fruitless after a military confrontation ibn saud announced a ceasefire in may 1934 imam yahya agreed to release saudi hostages and the surrender of the idrisis to saudi custody imam yahya ceded the three provinces of najran asir and jazan for 20 years and signed another treaty with the british government in 1934 the imam recognized the british sovereignty over aden protectorate for 40 years out of fear for hudaydah yahya did submit to these demands according to bernard reich professor of political science and international affairs at george washington university yahya could have done better by reorganizing the zaydi tribes of the northern highlands as his ancestors did against the turks and british intruders and turn the lands they captured into another graveyard british colony of aden
