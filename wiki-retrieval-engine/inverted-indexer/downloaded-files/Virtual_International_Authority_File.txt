contents discussion about having a common international authority started in the late 1990s after a series of failed attempts to come up with a unique common authority file the new idea was to link existing national authorities this would present all the benefits of a common file without requiring a large investment of time and expense in the process the project was initiated by the us library of congress lc the german national library dnb and the oclc on august 6 2003 the biblioth que nationale de france bnf joined the project on october 5 2007 the project transitioned to being a service of the oclc on april 4 2012 the aim is to link the national authority files such as the german name authority file to a single virtual authority file in this file identical records from the different data sets are linked together a viaf record receives a standard data number contains the primary see and see also records from the original records and refers to the original authority records the data are made available online and are available for research and data exchange and sharing reciprocal updating uses the open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting oai pmh protocol the
