from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search internal rotation in the sun showing differential rotation in the outer convective region and almost uniform rotation in the central radiative region the transition between these regions is called the tachocline the tachocline is the transition region of the sun between the radiative interior and the differentially rotating outer convective zone it is in the outer third of the sun by radius this causes the region to have a very large shear as the rotation rate changes very rapidly the convective exterior rotates as a normal fluid with differential rotation with the poles rotating slowly and the equator rotating quickly the radiative interior exhibits solid body rotation possibly due to a fossil field the rotation rate through the interior is roughly equal to the rotation rate at mid latitudes i e in between the rate at the slow poles and the fast equator recent results from helioseismology indicate that the tachocline is located at a radius of at most 0.70 times the solar radius measured from the core i e the surface is at 1 solar radius with a thickness of 0.04 times the solar radius this would mean the area has a very large shear profile that is one way that large scale magnetic fields can be formed the geometry and width of the tachocline are thought to play an important role in models of the solar dynamo by winding up the weaker poloidal field to create a much stronger toroidal field recent radio observations of cooler stars and brown dwarfs which do not have a radiative core and only have a convective zone demonstrate that they maintain large scale solar strength magnetic fields and display solar like activity despite the absence of tachoclines this suggests that the convective zone alone may be responsible for the function of the solar dynamo the term tachocline was coined in a paper by edward spiegel and jean paul zahn in 1992 by analogy to the oceanic thermocline an illustration of the structure of the sun granules sunspot photosphere chromosphere convection zone radiation zone tachocline solar core corona flare prominence solar wind section 3.2 from living reviews in solar physics charbonneau p christensen dalsgaard j henning r larsen r m schou j thompson m j tomczyk s 1999a helioseismic constraints on the structure of the solar tachocline astrophys j 527 445-460 2 basu s antia h m narasimha d 1994 helioseismic measurement of the extent of overshoot below the solar convection zone mon not r astron soc 267 209-224 3 hughes d w rosner r weiss n o 2007 the solar tachocline 382pp cambridge university press v t e the sun internal structure core radiation zone tachocline convection zone atmosphere photosphere supergranulation granule faculae sunspot chromosphere plage spicule moreton wave corona transition region coronal hole coronal loop coronal mass ejection prominence helmet streamer supra arcade downflows variation solar cycle list of solar cycles solar maximum solar minimum wolf number solar wind flare helioseismology heliosphere current sheet termination shock heliosheath heliopause bow shock related topics heliophysics solar activity solar astronomy solar dynamo eclipse solar energy solar neutrino solar observation solar phenomena solar physics solar system solar telescope solar time space weather standard solar model radiation spectral class g2v this article related to the sun is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title tachocline oldid 823760855 categories sunsun stubshidden categories all stub articles
