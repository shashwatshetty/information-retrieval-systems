from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article s factual accuracy may be compromised due to out of date information august 2016 the following is a list of solar cycles sometimes called sunspot cycles tracked since 1755 following the original numbering proposed by rudolf wolf in the mid-19th century the source data are the revised international sunspot numbers isn v2.0 as available at silso sunspot number counts exist since 1610 but the cycle numbering is not well defined during the maunder minimum it was proposed that one cycle might have been lost in the late 18th century but this still remains not fully confirmed the smoothing was done using the traditional sidc smoothing formula other smoothing formulas exist and they usually give slightly different values for the amplitude and timings of the solar cycles an example is the meeus smoothing formula with related solar cycles characteristics available in this stce news item in the table below the number of spotless days is the number between the maximum of the previous solar cycle and the maximum of the new solar cycle as an example there were 817 spotless days during the transit from solar cycle 23 to solar cycle 24 solar cycle start smoothed minimum isn maximum smoothed maximum isn time of rise years duration years spotless days solar cycle 1 1755 february 14.0 1761 june 144.1 6.3 11.3
