common mineral in earth s subsurface but weathers quickly on the surface the ratio of magnesium to iron varies between the two endmembers of the solid solution series forsterite mg endmember mg2sio4 and fayalite fe endmember fe2sio4 compositions of olivine are commonly expressed as molar percentages of forsterite fo and fayalite fa e g fo70fa30 forsterite s melting temperature is unusually high at atmospheric pressure almost 1,900 c 3,450 f while fayalite s is much lower about 1,200 c 2,190 f melting temperature varies smoothly between the two endmembers as do other properties olivine incorporates only minor amounts of elements other than oxygen silicon magnesium and iron manganese and nickel commonly are the additional elements present in highest concentrations olivine gives its name to the group of minerals with a related structure the olivine group which includes tephroite mn2sio4 monticellite camgsio4 and kirschsteinite cafesio4 olivine s crystal structure incorporates aspects of the orthorhombic p bravais lattice which arise from each silica sio4 unit being joined by metal divalent cations with each oxygen in sio4 bound to 3 metal ions it has a spinel like structure similar to magnetite but uses one quadravalent and two divalent cations m22 m4 o4 instead of two trivalent and one divalent cations olivine gemstones are called peridot and chrysolite olivine rock is usually harder than surrounding rock and stands out as distinct ridges in the terrain these ridges are often dry with little soil drought resistant scots pine is one of few trees that thrive on olivine rock olivine pine forest is unique to norway it is rare and found on dry olivine ridges in the fjord districts of sunnm re and nordfjord olivine rock is hard and base rich the habitat is endangered by mining and road construction contents olivine grains which eroded from lava on papakolea beach hawaii light green olivine crystals in peridotite xenoliths in basalt from arizona olivine basalt from the moon collected by the crew of apollo 15 olivine is named for its typically olive green color thought to be a result of traces of nickel though it may alter to a reddish color from the oxidation of iron translucent olivine is sometimes used as a gemstone called peridot p ridot the french word for olivine it is also called chrysolite or chrysolithe from the greek words for gold and stone some of the finest gem quality olivine has been obtained from a body of mantle rocks on zabargad island in the red sea olivine occurs in both mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks and as a primary mineral in certain metamorphic rocks mg rich olivine crystallizes from magma that is rich in magnesium and low in silica that magma crystallizes to mafic rocks such as gabbro and basalt ultramafic rocks such as peridotite and dunite can be residues left after extraction of magmas and typically they are more enriched in olivine after extraction of partial melts olivine and high pressure structural variants constitute over 50 of the earth s upper mantle and olivine is one of the earth s most common minerals by volume the metamorphism of impure dolomite or other sedimentary rocks with high magnesium and low silica content also produces mg rich olivine or forsterite fe rich olivine is relatively much less common but it occurs in igneous rocks in small amounts in rare granites and rhyolites and extremely fe rich olivine can exist stably with quartz and tridymite in contrast mg rich olivine does not occur stably with silica minerals as it would react with them to form orthopyroxene mg fe 2si2o6 mg rich olivine is stable to pressures equivalent to a depth of about 410 km 250 mi within earth because it is thought to be the most abundant mineral in earth s mantle at shallower depths the properties of olivine have a dominant influence upon the rheology of that part of earth and hence upon the solid flow that drives plate tectonics experiments have documented that olivine at high pressures e g 12 gpa the pressure at depths of about 360 km 220 mi can contain at least as much as about 8900 parts per million weight of water and that such water contents drastically reduce the resistance of olivine to solid flow moreover because olivine is so abundant more water may be dissolved in olivine of the mantle than contained in earth s oceans first x ray view of martian soil feldspar pyroxenes olivine revealed curiosity rover at rocknest october 17 2012 mg rich olivine has also been discovered in meteorites on the moon and mars falling into infant stars as well as on asteroid 25143 itokawa such meteorites include chondrites collections of debris from the early solar system and pallasites mixes of iron nickel and olivine the spectral signature of olivine has been seen in the dust disks around young stars the tails of comets which formed from the dust disk around the young sun often have the spectral signature of olivine and the presence of olivine was verified in samples of a comet from the stardust spacecraft in 2006 comet like magnesium rich olivine has also been detected in the planetesimal belt around the star beta pictoris figure 1 the atomic scale structure of olivine looking along the a axis oxygen is shown in red silicon in pink and magnesium iron in blue a projection of the unit cell is shown by the black rectangle minerals in the olivine group crystallize in the orthorhombic system space group pbnm with isolated silicate tetrahedra meaning that olivine is a nesosilicate in an alternative view the atomic structure can be described as a hexagonal close packed array of oxygen ions with half of the octahedral sites occupied with magnesium or iron ions and one eighth of the tetrahedral sites occupied by silicon ions there are three distinct oxygen sites marked o1 o2 and o3 in figure 1 two distinct metal sites m1 and m2 and only one distinct silicon site o1 o2 m2 and si all lie on mirror planes while m1 exists on an inversion center o3 lies in a general position at the high temperatures and pressures found at depth within the earth the olivine structure is no longer stable below depths of about 410 km 250 mi olivine undergoes an exothermic phase transition to the sorosilicate wadsleyite and at about 520 km 320 mi depth wadsleyite transforms exothermically into ringwoodite which has the spinel structure at a depth of about 660 km 410 mi ringwoodite decomposes into silicate perovskite mg fe sio3 and ferropericlase mg fe o in an endothermic reaction these phase transitions lead to a discontinuous increase in the density of the earth s mantle that can be observed by seismic methods they are also thought to influence the dynamics of mantle convection in that the exothermic transitions reinforce flow across the phase boundary whereas the endothermic reaction hampers it the pressure at which these phase transitions occur depends on temperature and iron content at 800 c 1,070 k 1,470 f the pure magnesium end member forsterite transforms to wadsleyite at 11.8 gigapascals 116,000 atm and to ringwoodite at pressures above 14 gpa 138,000 atm increasing the iron content decreases the pressure of the phase transition and narrows the wadsleyite stability field at about 0.8 mole fraction fayalite olivine transforms directly to ringwoodite over the pressure range 10.0 to 11.5 gpa 99,000 113,000 atm fayalite transforms to spinel at pressures below 5 gpa 49,000 atm increasing the temperature increases the pressure of these phase transitions olivine altered to iddingsite within a mantle xenolith olivine is one of the weaker common minerals on the surface according to the goldich dissolution series it alters into iddingsite a combination of clay minerals iron oxides and ferrihydrites readily in the presence of water artificially increasing the weathering rate of olivine e g by dispersing fine grained olivine on beaches has been proposed as a cheap way to sequester co2 the presence of iddingsite on mars would suggest that liquid water once existed there and might enable scientists to determine when there was last liquid water on the planet norway is the main source of olivine in europe particularly in an area stretching from heim to tafjord and from hornindal to flems y in the sunnm re district there is also olivine in eid municipality about 50 of the world s olivine for industrial use is produced in norway at svarthammaren in norddal olivine was mined from around 1920 to 1979 with a daily output up to 600 metric tons olivine was also obtained from the construction site of the hydro power stations in tafjord at robbervika in norddal municipality an open pit mine has been in operation since 1984 the characteristic red color is reflected in several local names with red such as raudbergvik red rock bay or raudnakken red ridge open pit mining at sunnylvsfjorden hurtigruten ship passing hans str m in 1766 described the olivine s typical red color on the surface and the blue color within str m wrote that in norddal district large quantities of olivine were broken from the bedrock and used as sharpening stones kallskaret near tafjord is a nature reserve with olivine a worldwide search is on for cheap processes to sequester co2 by mineral reactions called enhanced weathering removal by reactions with olivine is an attractive option because it is widely available and reacts easily with the acid co2 from the atmosphere when olivine is crushed it weathers completely within a few years depending on the grain size all the co2 that is produced by burning one liter of oil can be sequestered by less than one liter of olivine the reaction is exothermic but slow to recover the heat produced by the reaction to produce electricity a large volume of olivine must be thermally well isolated the end products of the reaction are silicon dioxide magnesium carbonate and small amounts of iron oxide olivine is a used as a substitute for dolomite in steel works olivine is also used to tap blast furnaces in the steel industry acting as a plug removed in each steel run the aluminium foundry industry uses olivine sand to cast objects in aluminium olivine sand requires less water than silica sands while still holding the mold together during handling and pouring of the metal less water means less gas steam to vent from the mold as metal is poured into the mold in finland olivine is marketed as an ideal rock for sauna stoves because of its comparatively high density and resistance to weathering under repeated heating and cooling bowen s
