65 best visible at 21 00 9 p m during the month of taurus latin for the bull is one of the constellations of the zodiac which means it is crossed by the plane of the ecliptic taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere s winter sky it is one of the oldest constellations dating back to at least the early bronze age when it marked the location of the sun during the spring equinox its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of ancient sumer akkad assyria babylon egypt greece and rome a number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to earth the pleiades and the hyades both of which are visible to the naked eye at first magnitude the red giant aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation in the northwest part of taurus is the supernova remnant messier 1 more commonly known as the crab nebula one of the closest regions of active star formation the taurus auriga complex crosses into the northern part of the constellation the variable star t tauri is the prototype of a class of pre main sequence stars contents taurus is a big and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere s winter sky between aries to the west and gemini to the east to the north lies perseus and auriga to the southeast orion to the south eridanus and to the southwest cetus in september and october taurus is visible in the evening along the eastern horizon the most favorable time to observe taurus in the night sky is during the months of december and january by march and april the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight this constellation forms part of the zodiac and hence is intersected by the ecliptic this circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the sun as the earth completes its annual orbit as the orbital plane of the moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic they can usually be found in the constellation taurus during some part of each year the galactic plane of the milky way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between taurus and auriga taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator celestial equator and ecliptic a ring like galactic structure known as gould s belt passes through the constellation the recommended three letter abbreviation for the constellation as adopted by the international astronomical union in 1922 is tau the official constellation boundaries as set by eug ne delporte in 1930 are defined by a polygon of 26 segments in the equatorial coordinate system the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 03h 23.4m and 05h 53.3m while the declination coordinates are between 31.10 and 1.35 because a small part of the constellation lies to the south of the celestial equator this can not be a completely circumpolar constellation at any latitude the constellation taurus as it can be seen by the naked eye the constellation lines have been added for clarity during november the taurid meteor shower appears to radiate from the general direction of this constellation the beta taurid meteor shower occurs during the months of june and july in the daytime and is normally observed using radio techniques between 18 and 29 october both the northern taurids and the southern taurids are active though the latter stream is stronger however between november 1 and 10 the two streams equalize the brightest member of this constellation is aldebaran an orange hued spectral class k5 iii giant star its name derives from al dabar n arabic for the follower probably from the fact that it follows the pleiades during the nightly motion of the celestial sphere across the sky forming the profile of a bull s face is a v or k shaped asterism of stars this outline is created by prominent members of the hyades the nearest distinct open star cluster after the ursa major moving group in this profile aldebaran forms the bull s bloodshot eye which has been described as glaring menacingly at the hunter orion a constellation that lies just to the southwest the hyades span about 5 of the sky so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye it includes a naked eye double star theta tauri with a separation of 5.6 arcminutes in the northeastern quadrant of the taurus constellation lie the pleiades m45 one of the best known open clusters easily visible to the naked eye the seven most prominent stars in this cluster are at least visual magnitude six and so the cluster is also named the seven sisters however many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope astronomers estimate that the cluster has approximately 500-1,000 stars all of which are around 100 million years old however they vary considerably in type the pleiades themselves are represented by large bright stars also many small brown dwarfs and white dwarfs exist the cluster is estimated to dissipate in another 250 million years the pleiades cluster is classified as a shapley class c and trumpler class i 3 r n cluster indicating that it is irregularly shaped and loose though concentrated at its center and detached from the star field in the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the pleiades lies the crystal ball nebula known by its catalogue designation of ngc 1514 this planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by german born english astronomer william herschel in 1790 prior to that time astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars however herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type in 1864 english astronomer william huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas rather than stars to the west the two horns of the bull are formed by beta tauri and zeta tauri two star systems that are separated by 8 beta is a white spectral class b7 iii giant star known as el nath which comes from the arabic phrase the butting as in butting by the horns of the bull at magnitude 1.65 it is the second brightest star in the constellation and shares the border with the neighboring constellation of auriga as a result it also bears the designation gamma aurigae zeta tauri is an eclipsing binary star that completes an orbit every 133 days brightest ngc objects in taurus identifier mag object type ngc 1514 10.9 planetary nebula ngc 1647 6.4 open cluster ngc 1746 6 asterism ngc 1817 7.7 open cluster ngc 1952 8.4 supernova remnant m1 a degree to the northwest of tauri is the crab nebula m1 a supernova remnant this expanding nebula was created by a type ii supernova explosion which was seen from earth on july 4 1054 it was bright enough to be observed during the day and is mentioned in chinese historical texts at its peak the supernova reached magnitude 4 but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe north american peoples also observed the supernova as evidenced from a painting on a new mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event however the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731 when john bevis found it the star lambda tauri is an eclipsing binary star this system consists of a spectral class b3 star being orbited by a less massive class a4 star the plane of their orbit lies almost along the line of sight to the earth every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion the two stars are separated by only 0.1 astronomical units so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction this results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit central area of constellation taurus showing aldebaran at the lower left located about 1.8 west of epsilon tauri is t tauri the prototype of a class of variable stars called t tauri stars this star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity varying between magnitude 9 to 13 over a period of weeks or months this is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust but has not yet become a main sequence star the surrounding reflection nebula ngc 1555 is illuminated by t tauri and thus is also variable in luminosity to the north lies kappa tauri a visual double star consisting of two a7 type components the pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes making them a challenge to split with the naked eye this constellation includes part of the taurus auriga complex or taurus dark clouds a star forming region containing sparse filamentary clouds of gas and dust this spans a diameter of 98 light years 30 parsecs and contains 35,000 solar masses of material which is both larger and less massive than the orion nebula at a distance of 490 light years 150 parsecs this is one of the nearest active star forming regions located in this region about 10 to the northeast of aldebaran is an asterism ngc 1746 spanning a width of 45 arcminutes see also bull mythology taurus as depicted in the astronomical treatise book of fixed stars by the persian astronomer abd al rahman al sufi c 964 taurus as depicted in urania s mirror a set of constellation cards published in london c.1825 the identification of the constellation of taurus with a bull is very old certainly dating to the chalcolithic and perhaps even to the upper paleolithic michael rappengl ck of the university of munich believes that taurus is represented in a cave painting at the hall of the bulls in the caves at lascaux dated to roughly 15,000 bc which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the pleiades the name seven sisters has been used for the pleiades in the languages of many cultures including indigenous groups of australia north america and siberia this suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin taurus marked the point of vernal spring equinox in the chalcolithic and the early bronze age from about 4000 bc to 1700 bc after which it moved into the neighboring constellation aries the pleiades were closest to the sun at vernal equinox around the 23rd century bc in babylonian astronomy the constellation was listed in the mul apin as the bull of heaven as this constellation marked the vernal equinox it was also the first constellation in the babylonian zodiac and they described it as the bull in front the akkadian name was alu in the old babylonian epic of gilgamesh the goddess ishtar sends taurus the bull of heaven to kill gilgamesh for spurning her advances enkidu tears off the bull s hind part and hurls the quarters into the sky where they become the stars we know as ursa major and ursa minor some locate gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of orion facing taurus as if in combat while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation in early mesopotamian art the bull of heaven was closely associated with inanna the sumerian goddess of sexual love fertility and warfare one of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess standard since it has 3 stars depicted on its back the cuneiform sign for star constellation there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as taurus the same iconic representation of the heavenly bull was depicted in the dendera zodiac an egyptian bas relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the celestial hemisphere using a planisphere in these ancient cultures the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward this differed from the later greek depiction where the horns pointed forward to the egyptians the constellation taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring when the spring equinox entered taurus the constellation would become covered by the sun in the western sky as spring began this sacrifice led to the renewal of the land to the early hebrews taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet aleph in greek mythology taurus was identified with zeus who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull to abduct europa a legendary phoenician princess in illustrations of greek mythology only the front portion of this constellation are depicted this was sometimes explained as taurus being partly submerged as he carried europa out to sea a second greek myth portrays taurus as io a mistress of zeus to hide his lover from his wife hera zeus changed io into the form of a heifer greek mythographer acusilaus marks the bull taurus as the same that formed the myth of the cretan bull one of the twelve labors of heracles taurus became an important object of worship among the druids their tauric religious festival was held while the sun passed through the constellation among the arctic people known as the inuit the constellation is called sakiattiat and the hyades is nanurjuk with the latter representing the spirit of the polar bear aldebaran represents the bear with the remainder of the stars in the hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay in buddhism legends hold that gautama buddha was born when the full moon was in vaisakha or taurus buddha s birthday is celebrated with the wesak festival or ves kha which occurs on the first or second full moon when the sun is in taurus main article taurus astrology as of 2008 update the sun appears in the constellation taurus from may 13 to june 21 in tropical astrology the sun is considered to be in the sign taurus from april 20 to
