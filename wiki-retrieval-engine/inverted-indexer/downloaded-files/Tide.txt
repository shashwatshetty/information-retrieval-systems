hypothetical case of an ocean of constant depth with no land there would also be smaller superimposed bulges on the sides facing toward and away from the sun in maine u s low tide occurs roughly at moonrise and high tide with a high moon corresponding to the simple gravity model of two tidal bulges at most places however moon and tides have a phase shift tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and the sun and the rotation of earth the times and amplitude of tides at any given locale are influenced by the alignment of the sun and moon by the pattern of tides in the deep ocean by the amphidromic systems of the oceans and the shape of the coastline and near shore bathymetry see timing some shorelines experience a semi diurnal tide two nearly equal high and low tides each day other locations experience a diurnal tide only one high and low tide each day a mixed tide two uneven tides a day or one high and one low is also possible tides vary on timescales ranging from hours to years due to a number of factors to make accurate records tide gauges at fixed stations measure water level over time gauges ignore variations caused by waves with periods shorter than minutes these data are compared to the reference or datum level usually called mean sea level while tides are usually the largest source of short term sea level fluctuations sea levels are also subject to forces such as wind and barometric pressure changes resulting in storm surges especially in shallow seas and near coasts tidal phenomena are not limited to the oceans but can occur in other systems whenever a gravitational field that varies in time and space is present for example the solid part of the earth is affected by tides though this is not as easily seen as the water tidal movements contents types of tides see timing below for coastal map tide changes proceed via the following stages sea level rises over several hours covering the intertidal zone flood tide the water rises to its highest level reaching high tide sea level falls over several hours revealing the intertidal zone ebb tide the water stops falling reaching low tide oscillating currents produced by tides are known as tidal streams the moment that the tidal current ceases is called slack water or slack tide the tide then reverses direction and is said to be turning slack water usually occurs near high water and low water but there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those of high and low water tides are commonly semi diurnal two high waters and two low waters each day or diurnal one tidal cycle per day the two high waters on a given day are typically not the same height the daily inequality these are the higher high water and the lower high water in tide tables similarly the two low waters each day are the higher low water and the lower low water the daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the moon is over the equator from the highest level to the lowest highest astronomical tide hat the highest tide which can be predicted to occur note that

illustration by the course of half a month tidal constituents are the net result of multiple influences impacting tidal changes over certain periods of time primary constituents include the earth s rotation the position of the moon and sun relative to the earth the moon s altitude elevation above the earth s equator and bathymetry variations with periods of less than half a day are called harmonic constituents conversely cycles of days months or years are referred to as long period constituents tidal forces affect the entire earth but the movement of solid earth occurs by mere centimeters in contrast the atmosphere is much more fluid and compressible so its surface moves by kilometers in the sense of the contour level of a particular low pressure in the outer atmosphere see also earth tide tidal constituents in most locations the largest constituent is the principal lunar semi diurnal also known as the m2 or m2 tidal constituent its period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes exactly half a tidal lunar day which is the average time separating one lunar zenith from the next and thus is the time required for the earth to rotate once relative to the moon simple tide clocks track this constituent the lunar day is longer than the earth day because the moon orbits in the same direction the earth spins this is analogous to the minute hand on a watch crossing the hour hand at 12 00 and then again at about 1 05 not at 1 00 the moon orbits the earth in the same direction as the earth rotates on its axis so it takes slightly more than a day about 24 hours and 50 minutes for the moon to return to the same location in the sky during this time it has passed overhead culmination once and underfoot once at an hour angle of 00 00 and 12 00 respectively so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above mentioned about 12 hours and 25 minutes the moment of highest tide is not necessarily when the moon is nearest to zenith or nadir but the period of the forcing still determines the time between high tides because the gravitational field created by the moon weakens with distance from the moon it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the earth facing the moon and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side the moon thus tends to stretch the earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies the solid earth deforms a bit but ocean water being fluid is free to move much more in response to the tidal force particularly horizontally as the earth rotates the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the earth s surface change constantly although the ocean never reaches equilibrium there is never time for the fluid to catch up to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height when there are two high tides each day with different heights and two low tides also of different heights the pattern is called a mixed semi diurnal tide the types of tides animation of tides as the moon goes round the earth with the sun on the right main article tidal range the semi diurnal range the difference in height between high and low waters over about half a day varies in a two week cycle approximately twice a month around new moon and full moon when the sun moon and earth form a line a configuration known as a syzygy the tidal force due to the sun reinforces that due to the moon the tide s range is then at its maximum this is called the spring tide it is not named after the season but like that word derives from the meaning jump burst forth rise as in a natural spring when the moon is at first quarter or third quarter the sun and moon are separated by 90 when viewed from the earth and the solar tidal force partially cancels the moon s at these points in the lunar cycle the tide s range is at its minimum this is called the neap tide or neaps neap is an anglo saxon word meaning without the power as in for ganges nip forth going without the power spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average low waters that are lower than average slack water time that is shorter than average and stronger tidal currents than average neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions there is about a seven day interval between springs and neaps spring tide sun and moon on the same side 0 neap tide sun and moon at 90 spring tide sun and moon at opposite sides 180 neap tide sun and moon at 270 spring tide sun and moon at the same side cycle

separating the moon and earth also affects tide heights when the moon is closest at perigee the range increases and when it is at apogee the range shrinks every lunations the full cycles from full moon to new to full perigee coincides with either a new or full moon causing perigean spring tides with the largest tidal range even at its most powerful this force is still weak causing tidal differences of inches at most these include solar gravitational effects the obliquity tilt of the earth s equator and rotational axis the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit and the elliptical shape of the earth s orbit of the sun a compound tide or overtide results from the shallow water interaction of its two parent waves the m2 tidal constituent amplitude is indicated by color and the white lines are cotidal differing by 1 hour the colors indicate where tides are most extreme highest highs lowest lows with blues being least extreme in almost a dozen places on this map the lines converge notice how at each of these places the surrounding color is blue indicating little or no tide these convergent areas are called amphidromic points the curved arcs around the amphidromic points show the direction of the tides each indicating a synchronized 6 hour period tidal ranges generally increase with increasing distance from amphidromic points tide waves move around these points generally counterclockwise in the n hemisphere and clockwise in the s hemisphere because the m2 tidal constituent dominates in most locations the stage or phase of a tide denoted by the time in hours after high water is a useful concept tidal stage is also measured in degrees with 360 per tidal cycle lines of constant tidal phase are called cotidal lines which are analogous to contour lines of constant altitude on topographical maps high water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean and cotidal lines and hence tidal phases advance along the coast semi diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water diurnal from maximum flood tide this and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent for an ocean in the shape of a circular basin enclosed by a coastline the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point the amphidromic point the amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters which is satisfied by zero tidal motion the rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island as it does around new zealand iceland and madagascar tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude half the distance between high and low water which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point for a semi diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line high water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines and away from ebbing cotidal lines this rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and is caused by the coriolis effect the difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch the reference tide is the hypothetical constituent equilibrium tide on a landless earth measured at 0 longitude the greenwich meridian in the north atlantic because the cotidal lines circulate counterclockwise around the amphidromic point the high tide passes new york harbor approximately an hour ahead of norfolk harbor south of cape hatteras the tidal forces are more complex and cannot be predicted reliably based on the north atlantic cotidal lines see also tidal force and theory of tides investigation into tidal physics was important in the early development of heliocentrism and celestial mechanics with the existence of two daily tides being explained by the moon s gravity later the daily tides were explained more precisely by the interaction of the moon s and the sun s gravity seleucus of seleucia theorized around 150 b c that tides were caused by the moon medieval understanding of the tides was primarily based on works of muslim astronomers which became available through latin translation starting from the 12th century abu ma shar d circa 886 in his introductorium in astronomiam taught that ebb and flood tides were caused by the moon although earlier in europe bede d 736 also reckoned that the moon is involved abu ma shar discussed the effects of wind and moon s phases relative to the sun on the tides in the 12th century al bitruji d circa 1204 contributed the notion that the tides were caused by the general circulation of the heavens simon stevin in his 1608 de spiegheling der ebbenvloet the theory of ebb and flood dismissed a large number of misconceptions that still existed about ebb and flood stevin pleaded for the idea that the attraction of the moon was responsible for the tides and spoke in clear terms about ebb flood spring tide and neap tide stressing that further research needed to be made in 1609 johannes kepler also correctly suggested that the gravitation of the moon caused the tides which he based upon ancient observations and correlations it was originally mentioned in ptolemy s tetrabiblos as having derived from ancient observation galileo galilei in his 1632 dialogue concerning the two chief world systems whose working title was dialogue on the tides gave an explanation of the tides the resulting theory however was incorrect as he attributed the tides to the sloshing of water caused by the earth s movement around the sun he hoped to provide mechanical proof of the earth s movement the value of his tidal theory is disputed galileo rejected kepler s explanation of the tides isaac newton 1642 1727 was the first person to explain tides as the product of the gravitational attraction of astronomical masses his explanation of the tides and many other phenomena was published in the principia 1687 and used his theory of universal gravitation to explain the lunar and solar attractions as the origin of the tide generating forces newton and others before pierre simon laplace worked the problem from the perspective of a static system equilibrium theory that provided an approximation that described the tides that would occur in a non inertial ocean evenly covering the whole earth the tide generating force or its corresponding potential is still relevant to tidal theory but as an intermediate quantity forcing function rather than as a final result theory must also consider the earth s accumulated dynamic tidal response to the applied forces which response is influenced by ocean depth the earth s rotation and other factors in 1740 the acad mie royale des sciences in paris offered a prize for the best theoretical essay on tides daniel bernoulli leonhard euler colin maclaurin and antoine cavalleri shared the prize maclaurin used newton s theory to show that a smooth sphere covered by a sufficiently deep ocean under the tidal force of a single deforming body is a prolate spheroid essentially a three dimensional oval with major axis directed toward the deforming body maclaurin was the first to write about the earth s rotational effects on motion euler realized that the tidal force s horizontal component more than the vertical drives the tide in 1744 jean le rond d alembert studied tidal equations for the atmosphere which did not include rotation in 1770 james cook s barque hms endeavour grounded on the great barrier reef attempts were made to refloat her on the following tide which failed but the tide after that lifted her clear with ease whilst she was being repaired in the mouth of the endeavour river cook observed the tides over a period of seven weeks at neap tides both tides in a day were similar but at springs the tides rose 7 feet 2.1 m in the morning but 9 feet 2.7 m in the evening pierre simon laplace formulated a system of partial differential equations relating the ocean s horizontal flow to its surface height the first major dynamic theory for water tides the laplace tidal equations are still in use today william thomson 1st baron kelvin rewrote laplace s equations in terms of vorticity which allowed for solutions describing tidally driven coastally trapped waves known as kelvin waves others including kelvin and henri poincar further developed laplace s theory based on these developments and the lunar theory of e w brown describing the motions of the moon arthur thomas doodson developed and published in 1921 the first modern development of the tide generating potential in harmonic form doodson distinguished 388 tidal frequencies some of his methods remain in use the tidal force produced by a massive object moon hereafter on a small particle located on or in an extensive body earth hereafter is the vector difference between the gravitational force exerted by the moon on the particle and the gravitational force that would be exerted on the particle if it were located at the earth s center of mass the solar gravitational force on the earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar but because the sun is on average 389 times farther from the earth its field gradient is weaker the solar tidal force is 46 as large as the lunar more precisely the lunar tidal acceleration along the moon earth axis at the earth s surface is about 1.1 10 7 g while the solar tidal acceleration along the sun earth axis at the earth s surface is about 0.52 10 7 g where g is the gravitational acceleration at the earth s surface venus has the largest effect of the other planets at 0.000113 times the solar effect the lunar gravity differential field at the earth s surface is known as the tide generating force this is the primary mechanism that drives tidal action and explains two equipotential tidal bulges accounting for two daily high waters the ocean s surface is closely approximated by an equipotential surface ignoring ocean currents commonly referred to as the geoid since the gravitational force is equal to the potential s gradient there are no tangential forces on such a surface and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the moon and sun these bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an equipotential surface on the earth this deformation has a fixed spatial orientation relative to the influencing body the earth s rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle gravitational forces follow an inverse square law force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance but tidal forces are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance the ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal equipotential rising when the tidal potential is high which occurs on the parts of the earth nearest to and furthest from the moon when the tidal equipotential changes the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts the surface then experiences a down slope in the direction that the equipotential has risen ocean depths are much smaller than their horizontal extent thus the response to tidal forcing can be modelled using the laplace tidal equations which incorporate the following features the vertical or radial velocity is negligible and there is no vertical shear this is a sheet flow the forcing is only horizontal tangential the coriolis effect appears as an inertial force fictitious acting laterally to the direction of flow and proportional to velocity the surface height s rate of change is proportional to the negative divergence of velocity multiplied by the depth as the horizontal velocity stretches or compresses the ocean as a sheet the volume thins or thickens respectively the boundary conditions dictate no flow across the coastline and free slip at the bottom the coriolis effect inertial force steers flows moving towards the equator to the west and flows moving away from the equator toward the east allowing coastally trapped waves finally a dissipation term can be added which is an analog to viscosity the theoretical amplitude of oceanic tides caused by the moon is about 54 centimetres 21 in at the highest point which corresponds to the amplitude that would be reached if the ocean possessed a uniform depth there were no landmasses and the earth were rotating in step with the moon s orbit the sun similarly causes tides of which the theoretical amplitude is about 25 centimetres 9.8 in 46 of that of the moon with a cycle time of 12 hours at spring tide the two effects add to each other to a theoretical level of 79 centimetres 31 in while at neap tide the theoretical level is reduced to 29 centimetres 11 in since the orbits of the earth about the sun and the moon about the earth are elliptical tidal amplitudes change somewhat as a result of the varying earth sun and earth moon distances this causes a variation in the tidal force and theoretical amplitude of about 18 for the moon and 5 for the sun if both the sun and moon were at their closest positions and aligned at new moon the theoretical amplitude would reach 93 centimetres 37 in real amplitudes differ considerably not only because of depth variations and continental obstacles but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period if there were no land masses it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength surface wave to propagate along the equator halfway around the earth by comparison the earth s lithosphere has a natural period of about 57 minutes earth tides which raise and lower the bottom of the ocean and the tide s own gravitational self attraction are both significant and further complicate the ocean s response to tidal forces see also tidal acceleration earth s tidal oscillations introduce dissipation at an average rate of about 3.75 terawatts about 98 of this dissipation is by marine tidal movement dissipation arises as basin scale tidal flows drive smaller scale flows which experience turbulent dissipation this tidal drag creates torque on the moon that gradually transfers angular momentum to its orbit and a gradual increase in earth moon separation the equal and opposite torque on the earth correspondingly decreases its rotational velocity thus over geologic time the moon recedes from the earth at about 3.8 centimetres 1.5 in year lengthening the terrestrial day day length has increased by about 2 hours in the last 600 million years assuming as a crude approximation that the deceleration rate has been constant this would imply that 70 million years ago day length was on the order of 1 shorter with about 4 more days per year the harbour of gorey jersey falls dry at low tide the shape of the shoreline and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate so there is no simple general rule that predicts the time of high water from the moon s position in the sky coastal characteristics such as underwater bathymetry and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting actual high water time and height may differ from model predictions due to the coastal morphology s effects on tidal flow however for a given location the relationship between lunar altitude and the time of high or low tide the lunitidal interval is relatively constant and predictable as is the time of high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast for example the high tide at norfolk virginia u s predictably occurs approximately two and a half hours before the moon passes directly overhead land masses and ocean basins act as barriers against water moving freely around the globe and their varied shapes and sizes affect the size of tidal frequencies as a result tidal patterns vary for example in the u s the east coast has predominantly semi diurnal tides as do europe s atlantic coasts while the west coast predominantly has mixed tides brouscon s almanach of 1546 compass bearings of high waters in the bay of biscay left and the coast from brittany to dover right brouscon s almanach of 1546 tidal diagrams according to the age of the moon from ancient times tidal observation and discussion has increased in sophistication first marking the daily recurrence then tides relationship to the sun and moon pytheas travelled to the british isles about 325 bc and seems to be the first to have related spring tides to the phase of the moon in the 2nd century bc the babylonian astronomer seleucus of seleucia correctly described the phenomenon of tides in order to support his heliocentric theory he correctly theorized that tides were caused by the moon although he believed that the interaction was mediated by the pneuma he noted that tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world according to strabo 1.1.9 seleucus was the first to link tides to the lunar attraction and that the height of the tides depends on the moon s position relative to the sun the naturalis historia of pliny the elder collates many tidal observations e g the spring tides are a few days after or before new and full moon and are highest around the equinoxes though pliny noted many relationships now regarded as fanciful in his geography strabo described tides in the persian gulf having their greatest range when the moon was furthest from the plane of the equator all this despite the relatively small amplitude of mediterranean basin tides the strong currents through the euripus strait and the strait of messina puzzled aristotle philostratus discussed tides in book five of the life of apollonius of tyana philostratus mentions the moon but attributes tides to spirits in europe around 730 ad the venerable bede described how the rising tide on one coast of the british isles coincided with the fall on the other and described the time progression of high water along the northumbrian coast the first tide table in china was recorded in 1056 ad primarily for visitors wishing to see the famous tidal bore in the qiantang river the first known british tide table is thought to be that of john wallingford who died abbot of st albans in 1213 based on high water occurring 48 minutes later each day and three hours earlier at the thames mouth than upriver at london william thomson lord kelvin led the first systematic harmonic analysis of tidal records starting in 1867 the main result was the building of a tide predicting machine using a system of pulleys to add together six harmonic time functions it was programmed by resetting gears and chains to adjust phasing and amplitudes similar machines were used until the 1960s the first known sea level record of an entire spring neap cycle was made in 1831 on the navy dock in the thames estuary many large ports had automatic tide gauge stations by 1850 william whewell first mapped co tidal lines ending with a nearly global chart in 1836 in order to make these maps consistent he hypothesized the existence of amphidromes where co tidal lines meet in the mid ocean these points of no tide were confirmed by measurement in 1840 by captain hewett rn from careful soundings in the north sea the same tidal forcing has different results depending on many factors including coast orientation continental shelf margin water body dimensions the tidal forces due to the moon and sun generate very long waves which travel all around the ocean following the paths shown in co tidal charts the time when the crest of the wave reaches a port then gives the time of high water at the port the time taken for the wave to travel around the ocean also means that there is a delay between the phases of the moon and their effect on the tide springs and neaps in the north sea for example are two days behind the new full moon and first third quarter moon this is called the tide s age the ocean bathymetry greatly influences the tide s exact time and height at a particular coastal point there are some extreme cases the bay of fundy on the east coast of canada is often stated to have the world s highest tides because of its shape bathymetry and its distance from the continental shelf edge measurements made in november 1998 at burntcoat head in the bay of fundy recorded a maximum range of 16.3 metres 53 ft and a highest predicted extreme of 17 metres 56 ft similar measurements made in march 2002 at leaf basin ungava bay in northern quebec gave similar values allowing for measurement errors a maximum range of 16.2 metres 53 ft and a highest predicted extreme of 16.8 metres 55 ft ungava bay and the bay of fundy lie similar distances from the continental shelf edge but ungava bay is free of pack ice for only about four months every year while the bay of fundy rarely freezes southampton in the united kingdom has a double high water caused by the interaction between the m2 and m4 tidal constituents portland has double low waters for the same reason the m4 tide is found all along the south coast of the united kingdom but its effect is most noticeable between the isle of wight and portland because the m2 tide is lowest in this region because the oscillation modes of the mediterranean sea and the baltic sea do not coincide with any significant astronomical forcing period the largest tides are close to their narrow connections with the atlantic ocean extremely small tides also occur for the same reason in the gulf of mexico and sea of japan elsewhere as along the southern coast of australia low tides can be due to the presence of a nearby amphidrome a regular water level chart isaac newton s theory of gravitation first enabled an explanation of why there were generally two tides a day not one and offered hope for a detailed understanding of tidal forces and behavior although it may seem that tides could be predicted via a sufficiently detailed knowledge of instantaneous astronomical forcings the actual tide at a given location is determined by astronomical forces accumulated over many days in addition precise results require detailed knowledge of the shape of all the ocean basins their bathymetry and coastline shape current procedure for analysing tides follows the method of harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by william thomson it is based on the principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of sun and moon determine a large number of component frequencies and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion but that at each place of interest on the earth the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality at each place of interest the tide heights are therefore measured for a period of time sufficiently long usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied to enable the response at each significant tide generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis and to extract the tidal constants for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction the tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force with a constant amplitude and phase delay for each component because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical tide generating forces has been found the main patterns in the tides are the twice daily variation the difference between the first and second tide of a day the spring neap cycle the annual variation the highest astronomical tide is the perigean spring tide when both the sun and moon are closest to the earth when confronted by a periodically varying function the standard approach is to employ fourier series a form of analysis that uses sinusoidal functions as a basis set having frequencies that are zero one two three etc times the frequency of a particular fundamental cycle these multiples are called harmonics of the fundamental frequency and the process is termed harmonic analysis if the basis set of sinusoidal functions suit the behaviour being modelled relatively few harmonic terms need to be added orbital paths are very nearly circular so sinusoidal variations are suitable for tides for the analysis of tide heights the fourier series approach has in practice to be made more elaborate than the use of a single frequency and its harmonics the tidal patterns are decomposed into many sinusoids having many fundamental frequencies corresponding as in the lunar theory to many different combinations of the motions of the earth the moon and the angles that define the shape and location of their orbits for tides then harmonic analysis is not limited to harmonics of a single frequency in other words the harmonies are multiples of many fundamental frequencies not just of the fundamental frequency of the simpler fourier series approach their representation as a fourier series having only one fundamental frequency and its integer multiples would require many terms and would be severely limited in the time range for which it would be valid the study of tide height by harmonic analysis was begun by laplace william thomson lord kelvin and george darwin a t doodson extended their work introducing the doodson number notation to organise the hundreds of resulting terms this approach has been the international standard ever since and the complications arise as follows the tide raising force is notionally given by sums of several terms each term is of the form where is the amplitude is the angular frequency usually given in degrees per hour corresponding to measured in hours and is the phase offset with regard to the astronomical state at time t 0 there is one term for the moon and a second term for the sun the phase of the first harmonic for the moon term is called the lunitidal interval or high water interval the next step is to accommodate the harmonic terms due to the elliptical shape of the orbits accordingly the value of is not a constant but also varying with time slightly about some average figure replace it then by where a is another sinusoid similar to the cycles and epicycles of ptolemaic theory accordingly which is to say an average value with a sinusoidal variation about it of magnitude with frequency and phase thus the simple term is now the product of two cosine factors given that for any and it is clear that a compound term involving the product of two cosine terms each with their own frequency is the same as three simple cosine terms that are to be added at the original frequency and also at frequencies which are the sum and difference of the two frequencies of the product term three not two terms since the whole expression is consider further that the tidal force on a location depends also on whether the moon or the sun is above or below the plane of the equator and that these attributes have their own periods also incommensurable with a day and a month and it is clear that many combinations result with a careful choice of the basic astronomical frequencies the doodson number annotates the particular additions and differences to form the frequency of each simple cosine term tidal prediction summing constituent parts remember that astronomical tides do not include weather effects also changes to local conditions sandbank movement dredging harbour mouths etc away from those prevailing at the measurement time affect the tide s actual timing and magnitude organisations quoting a highest astronomical tide for some location may exaggerate the figure as a safety factor against analytical uncertainties distance from the nearest measurement point changes since the last observation time ground subsidence etc to avert liability should an engineering work be overtopped special care is needed when assessing the size of a weather surge by subtracting the astronomical tide from the observed tide careful fourier data analysis over a nineteen year period the national tidal datum epoch in the u s uses frequencies called the tidal harmonic constituents nineteen years is preferred because the earth moon and sun s relative positions repeat almost exactly in the metonic cycle of 19 years which is long enough to include the 18.613 year lunar nodal tidal constituent this analysis can be done using only the knowledge of the forcing period but without detailed understanding of the mathematical derivation which means that useful tidal tables have been constructed for centuries the resulting amplitudes and phases can then be used to predict the expected tides these are usually dominated by the constituents near 12 hours the semi diurnal constituents but there are major constituents near 24 hours diurnal as well longer term constituents are 14 day or fortnightly monthly and semiannual semi diurnal tides dominated coastline but some areas such as the south china sea and the gulf of mexico are primarily diurnal in the semi diurnal areas the primary constituents m2 lunar and s2 solar periods differ slightly so that the relative phases and thus the amplitude of the combined tide change fortnightly 14 day period in the m2 plot above each cotidal line differs by one hour from its neighbors and the thicker lines show tides in phase with equilibrium at greenwich the lines rotate around the amphidromic points counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere so that from baja california peninsula to alaska and from france to ireland the m2 tide propagates northward in the southern hemisphere this direction is clockwise on the other hand m2 tide propagates counterclockwise around new zealand but this is because the islands act as a dam and permit the tides to have different heights on the islands opposite sides the tides do propagate northward on the east side and southward on the west coast as predicted by theory the exception is at cook strait where the tidal currents periodically link high to low water this is because cotidal lines 180 around the amphidromes are in opposite phase for example high water across from low water at each end of cook strait each tidal constituent has a different pattern of amplitudes phases and amphidromic points so the m2 patterns cannot be used for other tide components further information the article on a t doodson has a fully worked example calculation for bridgeport connecticut u s a tides at bridgeport connecticut u s a during a 50 hour period tides at bridgeport connecticut u s a during a 30 day period tides at bridgeport connecticut u s a during a 400 day period tidal patterns in cook strait the north part nelson has two spring tides per month versus only one on the south side wellington and napier because the moon is moving in its orbit around the earth and in the same sense as the earth s rotation a point on the earth must rotate slightly further to catch up so that the time between semidiurnal tides is not twelve but 12.4206 hours a bit over twenty five minutes extra the two peaks are not equal the two high tides a day alternate in maximum heights lower high just under three feet higher high just over three feet and again lower high likewise for the low tides when the earth moon and sun are in line sun earth moon or sun moon earth the two main influences combine to produce spring tides when the two forces are opposing each other as when the angle moon earth sun is close to ninety degrees neap tides result as the moon moves around its orbit it changes from north of the equator to south of the equator the alternation in high tide heights becomes smaller until they are the same at the lunar equinox the moon is above the equator then redevelop but with the other polarity waxing to a maximum difference and then waning again the tides influence on current flow is much more difficult to analyse and data is much more difficult to collect a tidal height is a simple number which applies to a wide region simultaneously a flow has both a magnitude and a direction both of which can vary substantially with depth and over short distances due to local bathymetry also although a water channel s center is the most useful measuring site mariners object when current measuring equipment obstructs waterways a flow proceeding up a curved channel is the same flow even though its direction varies continuously along the channel surprisingly flood and ebb flows are often not in opposite directions flow direction is determined by the upstream channel s shape not the downstream channel s shape likewise eddies may form in only one flow direction nevertheless current analysis is similar to tidal analysis in the simple case at a given location the flood flow is in mostly one direction and the ebb flow in another direction flood velocities are given positive sign and ebb velocities negative sign analysis proceeds as though these are tide heights in more complex situations the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate instead the flow direction and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle on a polar plot instead of along the ebb and flood lines in this case analysis might proceed along pairs of directions with the primary and secondary directions at right angles an alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers as each value has both a magnitude and a direction tide flow information is most commonly seen on nautical charts presented as a table of flow speeds and bearings at hourly intervals with separate tables for spring and neap tides the timing is relative to high water at some harbour where the tidal behaviour is similar in pattern though it may be far away as with tide height predictions tide flow predictions based only on astronomical factors do not incorporate weather conditions which can completely change the outcome the tidal flow through cook strait between the two main islands of new zealand is particularly interesting as the tides on each side of the strait are almost exactly out of phase so that one side s high water is simultaneous with the other s low water strong currents result with almost zero tidal height change in the strait s center yet although the tidal surge normally flows in one direction for six hours and in the reverse direction for six hours a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled in especially boisterous weather conditions the reverse surge might be entirely overcome so that the flow continues in the same direction through three or more surge periods a further complication for cook strait s flow pattern is that the tide at the north side e g at nelson follows the common bi weekly spring neap tide cycle as found along the west side of the country but the south side s tidal pattern has only one cycle per month as on the east side wellington and napier the graph of cook strait s tides shows separately the high water and low water height and time through november 2007 these are not measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years old measurements cook strait s nautical chart offers tidal current information for instance the january 1979 edition for 41 13 9 s 174 29 6 e north west of cape terawhiti refers timings to westport while the january 2004 issue refers to wellington near cape terawhiti in the middle of cook strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the tidal current reaches its maximum especially near the notorious karori rip aside from weather effects the actual currents through cook strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen only one of the two spring tides at the north end nelson has a counterpart spring tide at the south end wellington so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour main article tidal power tidal energy can be extracted by two means inserting a water turbine into a tidal current or building ponds that release admit water through a turbine in the first case the energy amount is entirely determined by the timing and tidal current magnitude however the best currents may be unavailable because the turbines would obstruct ships in the second the impoundment dams are expensive to construct natural water cycles are completely disrupted ship navigation is disrupted however with multiple ponds power can be generated at chosen times so far there are few installed systems for tidal power generation most famously la rance at saint malo france which face many difficulties aside from environmental issues simply withstanding corrosion and biological fouling pose engineering challenges tidal power proponents point out that unlike wind power systems generation levels can be reliably predicted save for weather effects while some generation is possible for most of the tidal cycle in practice turbines lose efficiency at lower operating rates since the power available from a flow is proportional to the cube of the flow speed the times during which high power generation is possible are brief us civil and maritime uses of tidal data tidal flows are important for navigation and significant errors in position occur if they are not accommodated tidal heights are also important for example many rivers and harbours have a shallow bar at the entrance which prevents boats with significant draft from entering at low tide until the advent of automated navigation competence in calculating tidal effects was important to naval officers the certificate of examination for lieutenants in the royal navy once declared that the prospective officer was able to shift his tides tidal flow timings and velocities appear in tide charts or a tidal stream atlas tide charts come in sets each chart covers a single hour between one high water and another they ignore the leftover 24 minutes and show the average tidal flow for that hour an arrow on the tidal chart indicates the direction and the average flow speed usually in knots for spring and neap tides if a tide chart is not available most nautical charts have tidal diamonds which relate specific points on the chart to a table giving tidal flow direction and speed the standard procedure to counteract tidal effects on navigation is to 1 calculate a dead reckoning position or dr from travel distance and direction 2 mark the chart with a vertical cross like a plus sign and 3 draw a line from the dr in the tide s direction the distance the tide moves the boat along this line is computed by the tidal speed and this gives an estimated position or ep traditionally marked with a dot in a triangle tidal indicator delaware river delaware c 1897 at the time shown in the figure the tide is feet above mean low water and is still falling as indicated by pointing of the arrow indicator is powered by system of pulleys cables and a float report of the superintendent of the coast geodetic survey showing the progress of the work during the fiscal year ending with june 1897 p 483 nautical charts display the water s charted depth at specific locations with soundings and the use of bathymetric contour lines to depict the submerged surface s shape these depths are relative to a chart datum which is typically the water level at the lowest possible astronomical tide although other datums are commonly used especially historically and tides may be lower or higher for meteorological reasons and are therefore the minimum possible water depth during the tidal cycle drying heights may also be shown on the chart which are the heights of the exposed seabed at the lowest astronomical tide tide tables list each day s high and low water heights and times to calculate the actual water depth add the charted depth to the published tide height depth for other times can be derived from tidal curves published for major ports the rule of twelfths can suffice if an accurate curve is not available this approximation presumes that the increase in depth in the six hours between low and high water is first hour 1 12 second 2 12 third 3 12 fourth 3 12 fifth 2 12 sixth 1 12 a rock seen at low water exhibiting typical intertidal zonation main article intertidal ecology further information intertidal zone intertidal ecology is the study of ecosystems between the low and high water lines along a shore at low water the intertidal zone is exposed or emersed whereas at high water it is underwater or immersed intertidal ecologists therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment as well as among the different species the most important interactions may vary according to the type of intertidal community the broadest classifications are based on substrates rocky shore or soft bottom intertidal organisms experience a highly variable and often hostile environment and have adapted to cope with and even exploit these conditions one easily visible feature is vertical zonation in which the community divides into distinct horizontal bands of specific species at each elevation above low water a species ability to cope with desiccation determines its upper limit while competition with other species sets its lower limit humans use intertidal regions for food and recreation overexploitation can damage intertidals directly other anthropogenic actions such as introducing invasive species and climate change have large negative effects marine protected areas are one option communities can apply to protect these areas and aid scientific research the approximately fortnightly tidal cycle has large effects on intertidal and marine organisms hence their biological rhythms tend to occur in rough multiples of this period many other animals such as the vertebrates display similar rhythms examples include gestation and egg hatching in humans the menstrual cycle lasts roughly a lunar month an even multiple of the tidal period such parallels at least hint at the common descent of all animals from a marine ancestor when oscillating tidal currents in the stratified ocean flow over uneven bottom topography they generate internal waves with tidal frequencies such waves are called internal tides shallow areas in otherwise open water can experience rotary tidal currents flowing in directions that continually change and thus the flow direction not the flow completes a full rotation in hours for example the nantucket shoals in addition to oceanic tides large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience atmospheric tides and earth tides these are continuum mechanical phenomena the first two take place in fluids the third affects the earth s thin solid crust surrounding its semi liquid interior with various modifications large lakes such as superior and erie can experience tides of 1 to 4 cm 0.39 to 1.6 in but these can be masked by meteorologically induced phenomena such as seiche the tide in lake michigan is described as 0.5 to 1.5 inches 13 to 38 mm or inches this is so small that other larger effects completely mask any tide and as such these lakes are considered non tidal atmospheric tides are negligible at ground level and aviation altitudes masked by weather s much more important effects atmospheric tides are both gravitational and thermal in origin and are the dominant dynamics from about 80 to 120 kilometres 50 to 75 mi above which the molecular density becomes too low to support fluid behavior main article earth tide earth tides or terrestrial tides affect the entire earth s mass which acts similarly to a liquid gyroscope with a very thin crust the earth s crust shifts in out east west north south in response to lunar and solar gravitation ocean tides and atmospheric loading while negligible for most human activities terrestrial tides semi diurnal amplitude can reach about 55 centimetres 22 in at the equator 15 centimetres 5.9 in due to the sun which is important in gps calibration and vlbi measurements precise astronomical angular measurements require knowledge of the earth s rotation rate and polar motion both of which are influenced by earth tides the semi diurnal m2 earth tides are nearly in phase with the moon with a lag of about two hours galactic tides are the tidal forces exerted by galaxies on stars within them and satellite galaxies orbiting them the galactic tide s effects on the solar system s oort cloud are believed to cause 90 percent of long period comets tsunamis the large waves that occur after earthquakes are sometimes called tidal waves but this name is given by their resemblance to the tide rather than any actual link
