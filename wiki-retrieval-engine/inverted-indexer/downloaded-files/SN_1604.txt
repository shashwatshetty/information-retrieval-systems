occurred in the milky way in the constellation ophiuchus appearing in 1604 it is the most recent supernova in our own galaxy to have been unquestionably observed by the naked eye occurring no farther than 6 kiloparsecs or about 20,000 light years from earth visible to the naked eye kepler s star was brighter at its peak than any other star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of 2.5 it was visible during the day for over three weeks records of its sighting exist in european chinese korean and arabic sources johannes kepler s original drawing from de stella nova 1606 depicting the location of the stella nova marked with an n 8 grid squares down 4 over from the left it was the second supernova to be observed in a generation after sn 1572 seen by tycho brahe in cassiopeia no further supernovae have since been observed with certainty in the milky way though many others outside our galaxy have been seen since s andromedae in 1885 sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud was easily visible to the naked eye evidence exists for two milky way supernovae whose signals would have reached earth c 1680 and 1870 cassiopeia a and g1.9 0.3 respectively there is no historical record of either having been detected in those years probably as absorption by interstellar dust made them fainter the supernova remnant resulting from kepler s supernova is considered to be one of the prototypical objects of its kind and is still an object of much study in astronomy johannes kepler along with other astronomers of the time was concerned with observing the conjunction of mars and jupiter which saw in terms of an auspicious conjunction linked in their minds to the star of bethlehem however cloudy weather prevented him making any celestial observations nevertheless his fellow astronomers wilhelm fabry michael maestlin and helisaeus roeslin were able to make observations on 9 october but did not record the supernova the first recorded observation in europe was by lodovico delle colombe in northern italy on 9 october 1604 the weather only enabled kepler to begin observing the luminous display on october 17 while working at the imperial court in prague for emperor rudolf ii it was subsequently named after him even though he was not its first observer as his observations tracked the object for an entire year and because of his book on the subject entitled de stella nova in pede serpentarii on the new star in ophiuchus s foot prague 1606 delle colombe went on to publish discourse of lodovico delle colombe in which he shows that the star newly appeared in october 1604 is neither a comet nor a new star in 1606 where he defended an aristotelian view of cosmology which was then sharply challenged by galileo galilei in kepler s de stella nova 1606 concerning this supernova kepler criticised roeslin he argued that in his astrological prognostications roeslin had picked out just the two comets the great comet of 1556 and 1580 roeslin responded in 1609 that this was indeed what he had done when kepler replied later that year he simply observed that by including a broader range of data roeslin could have made a better argument list of supernova remnants blair
