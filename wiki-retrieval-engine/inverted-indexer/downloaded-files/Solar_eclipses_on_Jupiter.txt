the two satellites visible io and europa just to the right of the planet are responsible for the shadows image was computer generated a simulated view of an io transit of jupiter as viewed from the earth showing the shadow apparently leading io a picture of jupiter and its moon io taken by hubble the black spot is io s shadow solar eclipses on jupiter occur when any of the natural satellites of jupiter pass in front of the sun as seen from the planet jupiter for bodies which appear smaller in angular diameter than the sun the proper term would be a transit for bodies which are larger than the apparent size of the sun the proper term would be an occultation there are five satellites capable of completely occulting the sun amalthea io europa ganymede and callisto all of the others are too small or too distant to be able to completely occult the sun so can only transit the sun most of the more distant satellites also have orbits that are strongly inclined to the plane of jupiter s orbit and would rarely be seen to transit when the four largest satellites of jupiter the galilean satellites occult the sun a shadow transit can be seen on the surface of jupiter which can be observed from earth in telescopes eclipses of the sun from jupiter are not particularly rare since jupiter is very large and its axial tilt which is related to the plane of the orbits of its satellites is relatively small indeed the vast majority of the orbits of all five of the objects capable of occulting the sun will result in a solar occultation visible from somewhere on jupiter s surface the related phenomenon of satellite eclipses in the shadow of jupiter has been observed since the time of giovanni cassini and ole r mer in the mid seventeenth century it was soon noticed that predicted times differed from observed times in a regular way varying from up to ten minutes early to up to ten minutes late r mer used these errors to make the first accurate determination of the speed of light correctly realizing that the variations were caused by the varying distance between earth and jupiter as the two planets moved in their orbits around the sun spacecraft can be used to observe the solar eclipses on jupiter these include pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 1973 and 1974 voyager 1 and voyager 2 1979 galileo orbiter 1995 2003 cassini huygens 2000 and new horizons 2007 observed the transits of their moons and its shadows the apparent sizes of the galilean moons as viewed from jupiter s surface units are expressed in arc seconds for comparison the mean angular diameter of the moon as viewed from earth is 1888 or 31 28 the mean angular diameter of the sun as viewed from jupiter is 372 arc seconds or 6 12 about that of the sun as viewed from earth varying slightly from 381 at perihelion to 357 at aphelion unlike the near coincidence of the apparent sizes of the moon and sun as viewed from earth this perspective exaggerates the apparent diameters of all the galilean moons in comparison to the sun even distant callisto is over 50 larger and io is nearly six times as large this disparity in angular size makes the moons shadows on jupiter more defined than the lunar shadow on earth during a total solar eclipse as it narrows the penumbra for a given distance skytonight predictions for eclipses of jovian moons and their shadow transits nasa astronomy picture of the
