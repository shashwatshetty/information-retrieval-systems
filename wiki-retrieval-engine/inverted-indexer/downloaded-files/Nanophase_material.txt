from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search nanophase materials are materials that have grain sizes under 100 nanometres they have different mechanical and optical properties compared to the large grained materials of the same chemical composition transparency and different transparent colours can be achieved with nanophase materials by varying the grain size nanophase metals usually are many times harder but more brittle than regular metals nanophase copper is a superhard material nanophase aluminum nanophase iron is iron with a grain size in the nanometer range nanocrystalline iron has a tensile strength of around 6 gpa twice that of the best maraging steels nanophase ceramics usually are more ductile and less brittle than regular ceramics creating nanophase materials scientific american subscription required nanophase materials michigan tech research on nanophase materials louisiana state university this material related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title nanophase material oldid 829572706 categories materialsmaterials stubshidden categories all stub articles
