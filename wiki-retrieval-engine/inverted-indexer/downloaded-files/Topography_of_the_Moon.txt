from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article relies largely or entirely on a single source june 2017 topography of the moon the topography of the moon has been measured by the methods of laser altimetry and stereo image analysis most recently from data obtained during the clementine mission the most visible topographic feature is the giant far side south pole aitken basin which possesses the lowest elevations of the moon the highest elevations are found just to the north east of this basin and it has been suggested that this area might represent thick ejecta deposits that were emplaced during an oblique south pole aitken basin impact event other large impact basins such as the maria imbrium serenitatis crisium smythii and orientale also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims another distinguishing feature of the moon s shape is that the elevations are on average about 1.9 km higher on the far side than the near side if it is assumed that the crust is in isostatic equilibrium and that the density of the crust is everywhere the same then the higher elevations would be associated with a thicker crust using gravity topography and seismic data the crust is thought to be on average about thick with the far side crust being on average thicker than the near side by about 15 km the moon lunar near side lunar far side lunar north pole lunar south pole moon oceanus procellarum ocean of storms ancient rift valleys rectangular structure visible topography grail gravity gradients october 1 2014 ancient rift valleys context ancient rift valleys closeup artist s concept gravitation of the moon v t e the moon physical properties internal structure topography atmosphere gravity field hill sphere magnetic field sodium tail moonlight earthshine orbit orbital elements distance perigee apogee nodes nodal period precession syzygy new moon full moon eclipses lunar eclipse total penumbral lunar eclipse tetrad solar eclipse solar eclipses on the moon eclipse cycle supermoon tide tidal force tidal locking tidal acceleration tidal range lunar mansion surface features selenography terminator hemispheres near side far side poles north pole south pole face maria list mountains peak of eternal light valleys volcanic features domes calderas craters list ray systems crater of eternal darkness shackleton crater south pole aitken basin soil swirls rilles wrinkle ridges rocks lunar basalt 70017 water space weathering micrometeorite sputtering quakes transient lunar phenomenon science observation libration lunar theory origin giant impact hypothesis theia lunar magma ocean geology timescale late heavy bombardment lunar meteorites kreep experiments lunar laser ranging alsep lunar sample displays apollo 11 apollo 17 exploration missions apollo program probes landing conspiracy theories colonization tourism time telling lunar calendar lunisolar calendar month lunar month nodal period fortnight sennight lunar mansion phases names new full names crescent super micro blood blue black dark wet tetrad related topics psychology lunar effect moon illusion pareidolia man in the moon moon rabbit craters named after people memorials on the moon moon in fiction moon in mythology hj ki and bil moon is made of green cheese natural satellite double planet lilith hypothetical second moon category moon portal earth sciences portal solar system portal retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title topography of the moon oldid 823772081 categories lunar sciencetopographygeodesyhidden categories articles needing additional references from june 2017all articles needing additional referencespages using multiple image with manual scaled images
