the world contents main article etymology of london the city s name may derive from the river thames the etymology of london is uncertain it is an ancient name attested already in the first century ad usually in the latinised form londinium for example handwritten roman tablets recovered in the city originating from ad 65 70-80 include the word londinio in london over the years the name has attracted many mythicising explanations the earliest attested appears in geoffrey of monmouth s historia regum britanniae written around 1136 this had it that the name originated from a supposed king lud who had allegedly taken over the city and named it kaerlud modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources latin usually londinium old english usually lunden and welsh usually llundein with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages it is agreed that the name came into these languages from british celtic recent work tends to reconstruct the lost celtic form of the name as londonjon or something similar this was adapted into latin as londinium and borrowed into west germanic the ancestor language of english already before english had become widely spoken in britain the etymology and original meaning of the british celtic form is much debated a prominent explanation was richard coates s 1998 argument that the name derived from pre celtic old european p lowonida meaning river too wide to ford coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the river thames which flows through london from this the settlement gained the celtic form of its name lowonidonjon however most work has accepted a celtic origin for the name and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a celtic derivative of an proto indo european root lendh sink cause to sink combined with the celtic suffix injo or onjo used to form place names peter schrijver has specifically suggested on these grounds that the name originally meant place that floods periodically tidally until 1889 the name london officially applied only to the city of london but since then it has also referred to the county of london and now to greater london london is sometimes abbreviated as l don or ldn main articles history of london and timeline of london two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the thames in the london area in 1999 the remains of a bronze age bridge were found on the foreshore north of vauxhall bridge this bridge either crossed the thames or reached a now lost island in it dendrochronology dated the timbers to ca 1500 bc in 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure dated to ca 4500 bc were found on the thames foreshore south of vauxhall bridge the function of the mesolithic structure is not known both structures are on the south bank at a natural crossing point where the river effra flows into the thames in 1300 the city was still confined within the roman walls although there is evidence of scattered brythonic settlements in the area the first major settlement was founded by the romans after the invasion of 43 ad this lasted only until around 61 when the iceni tribe led by queen boudica stormed it burning it to the ground the next heavily planned incarnation of londinium prospered and it superseded colchester as the capital of the roman province of britannia in 100 at its height in the 2nd century roman london had a population of around 60,000 with the collapse of roman rule in the early 5th century london ceased to be a capital and the walled city of londinium was effectively abandoned although roman civilisation continued in the area of st martin in the fields until around 450 from around 500 an anglo saxon settlement known as lundenwic developed slightly west of the old roman city by about 680 the city had regrown into a major port although there is little evidence of large scale production from the 820s repeated viking assaults brought decline three are recorded those in 851 and 886 succeeded while the last in 994 was rebuffed the lancastrian siege of london in 1471 is attacked by a yorkist sally the vikings established danelaw over much of eastern and northern england its boundary stretched roughly from london to chester it was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the viking incursions which was formally agreed by the danish warlord guthrum and the west saxon king alfred the great in 886 the anglo saxon chronicle recorded that alfred refounded london in 886 archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old roman walls london then grew slowly until about 950 after which activity increased dramatically by the 11th century london was beyond all comparison the largest town in england westminster abbey rebuilt in the romanesque style by king edward the confessor was one of the grandest churches in europe winchester had previously been the capital of anglo saxon england but from this time on london became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war in the view of frank stenton it had the resources and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self consciousness appropriate to a national capital westminster abbey as seen in this painting by canaletto 1749 is a world heritage site and one of london s oldest and most important buildings after winning the battle of hastings william duke of normandy was crowned king of england in the newly completed westminster abbey on christmas day 1066 william constructed the tower of london the first of the many norman castles in england to be rebuilt in stone in the southeastern corner of the city to intimidate the native inhabitants in 1097 william ii began the building of westminster hall close by the abbey of the same name the hall became the basis of a new palace of westminster in the 12th century the institutions of central government which had hitherto accompanied the royal english court as it moved around the country grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place for most purposes this was westminster although the royal treasury having been moved from winchester came to rest in the tower while the city of westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms its distinct neighbour the city of london remained england s largest city and principal commercial centre and it flourished under its own unique administration the corporation of london in 1100 its population was around 18,000 by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000 disaster struck in the form of the black death in the mid-14th century when london lost nearly a third of its population london was the focus of the peasants revolt in 1381 map of london in 1593 there is only one bridge across the thames but parts of southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed during the tudor period the reformation produced a gradual shift to protestantism and much of london property passed from church to private ownership which accelerated trade and business in the city in 1475 the hanseatic league set up its main trading base kontor of britain in london since called stalhof or steelyard it existed until 1853 when the hanseatic cities of l beck bremen and hamburg sold the property to south eastern railway woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th 15th century london to the nearby shores of the low countries where it was considered indispensable but the reach of english maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north west europe the commercial route to italy and the mediterranean sea normally lay through antwerp and over the alps any ships passing through the strait of gibraltar to or from england were likely to be italian or ragusan upon the re opening of the netherlands to english shipping in january 1565 there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity the royal exchange was founded mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the east india company were established with trade expanding to the new world london became the principal north sea port with migrants arriving from england and abroad the population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605 in the 16th century william shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in london at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre by the end of the tudor

brentford and turnham green london was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the lines of communication the lines were built by up to 20,000 people and were completed in under two months the fortifications failed their only test when the new model army entered london in 1647 and they were levelled by parliament the same year london was plagued by disease in the early 17th century culminating in the great plague of 1665 1666 which killed up to 100,000 people or a fifth of the population the great fire of london destroyed many parts of the city in 1666 the great fire of london broke out in 1666 in pudding lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by robert hooke as surveyor of london in 1708 christopher wren s masterpiece st paul s cathedral was completed during the georgian era new districts such as mayfair were formed in the west new bridges over the thames encouraged development in south london in the east the port of london expanded downstream london s development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s in 1762 george iii acquired buckingham house and it was enlarged

punishable by death including petty theft most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday view to the royal exchange in the city of london in 1886 the coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available and fleet street became the centre of the british press following the invasion of amsterdam by napoleonic armies many financiers relocated to london especially a large jewish community and the first london international issue was arranged in 1817 around the same time the royal navy became the world leading war fleet acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the united kingdom the repeal of the corn laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening dutch economic power london then overtook amsterdam as the leading international financial centre according to samuel johnson you find no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave london no sir when a man is tired of london he is tired of life for there is in london all that life can afford samuel johnson 1777 british volunteer recruits in london august 1914 london was the world s largest city from about 1831 to 1925 london s overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics claiming 14,000 lives in 1848 and 6,000 in 1866 rising traffic congestion led to the creation of

county council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital london was bombed by the germans during the first world war and during the second world war the blitz and other

england and the top level subdivision covering most of the city s metropolis the small ancient city of london at its core once comprised the whole settlement but as its urban area grew the corporation

some places just outside are included the greater london boundary has been aligned to the m25 motorway in places outward urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt although the

westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court and thus the political capital of the nation more recently greater london has been defined as a region of england and in this context is known as london london from primrose hill greater london encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres 611 sq mi an area which had a population of

thames its primary geographical feature a navigable river which crosses the city from the south west to the east the thames valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including parliament hill addington hills and primrose hill historically london grew up at the lowest bridging point on the thames the thames was once a much broader shallower river with extensive marshlands at high tide its shores reached five times their present width since the victorian era the thames has been extensively embanked and many of its london tributaries now flow underground the thames is a tidal river and london is vulnerable to flooding the threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow tilting of britain up in the north and down in the south caused by post glacial rebound in 1974 a decade of work began on the construction of the thames barrier across the thames at woolwich to deal with this threat while the barrier is expected
