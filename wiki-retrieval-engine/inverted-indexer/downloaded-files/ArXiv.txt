228652809 arxiv pronounced archive is a repository of electronic preprints known as e prints approved for publication after moderation that consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics physics astronomy computer science quantitative biology statistics and quantitative finance which can be accessed online in many fields of mathematics and physics almost all scientific papers are self archived on the arxiv repository begun on august 14 1991 arxiv org passed the half million article milestone on october 3 2008 and hit a million by the end of 2014 by october 2016 the submission rate had grown to more than 10,000 per month contents a screenshot of the arxiv taken in 1994 using the browser ncsa mosaic at the time html forms were a new technology the arxiv was made possible by the low bandwidth tex file format which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the internet and rendered client side around 1990 joanne cohn began emailing physics preprints to colleagues as tex files but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity paul ginsparg recognized the need for central storage and in august 1991 he created a central repository mailbox stored at the los alamos national laboratory which could be accessed from any computer additional modes of access were soon added ftp in 1991 gopher in 1992 and the world wide web in 1993 the term e print was quickly adopted to describe the articles it began as a physics archive called the lanl preprint archive but soon expanded to include astronomy mathematics computer science quantitative biology and most recently statistics its original domain name was xxx lanl gov due to lanl s lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology in 2001 ginsparg changed institutions to cornell university and changed the name of the repository to arxiv org it is now hosted principally by cornell with eight mirrors around the world its existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in scientific publishing known as open access mathematicians and scientists regularly upload their papers to arxiv org for worldwide access and sometimes for reviews before they are published in peer reviewed journals ginsparg was awarded a macarthur fellowship in 2002 for his establishment of arxiv the annual budget for arxiv is approximately 826,000 for 2013 to 2017 funded jointly by cornell university library the simons foundation in both gift and challenge grant forms and annual fee income from member institutions this model arose in 2010 when cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution annual donations were envisaged to vary in size between 2,300 to 4,000 based on each institution s usage as of 14 january 2014 update 174 institutions have pledged support for the period 2013 2017 on this basis with a projected revenue from this source of approximately 340,000 in september 2011 cornell university library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arxiv s operation and development ginsparg was quoted in the chronicle of higher education as saying it was supposed to be a three hour tour not a life sentence however ginsparg remains on the although the arxiv is not peer reviewed a collection of moderators for each area review the submissions they may recategorize any that are deemed off topic or reject submissions that are not scientific papers the lists of moderators for many sections of the arxiv are publicly available but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted additionally an endorsement system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines under the system for categories that use it an author must be endorsed by an established arxiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area new authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all however the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry a majority of the e prints are also submitted to journals for publication but some work including some very influential papers remain purely as e prints and are never published in a peer reviewed journal a well known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of thurston s geometrization conjecture including the poincar conjecture as a particular case uploaded by grigori perelman in november 2002 perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer reviewed journal process stating if anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem it s all there on the arxiv let them go and read about it despite this non traditional method of publication other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the fields medal and clay mathematics millennium prizes to perelman both of which he refused while the arxiv does contain some dubious e prints such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as fermat s last theorem using only high school mathematics they are surprisingly rare the arxiv generally re classifies these works e g in general mathematics rather than deleting them papers can be submitted in any of several formats including latex and pdf printed from a word processor other than tex or latex the submission is rejected by the arxiv software if generating the final pdf file fails if any image file is too large or if the total size of the submission is too large arxiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission and only finalize the submission when ready the time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized the standard access route is through the arxiv org website or one of several mirrors several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un associated organisations these include the university of california davis s front a web portal that offers additional search functions and a more self explanatory interface for arxiv org and is referred to by some mathematicians as the front a similar function used to be offered by eprintweb org launched in september 2006 by the institute of physics and was switched off on june 30 2014 carnegie mellon provides tablearxiv a search engine for tables extracted from arxiv publications google scholar and live search academic now defunct can also be used to search for items in arxiv a full text and author search engine for arxiv is provided by scientillion finally researchers can select sub fields and receive daily e mailings or rss feeds of all submissions in them files on arxiv can have a number of different copyright statuses some are public domain in which case they will have a statement saying so some are available under either the creative commons 3.0 attribution sharealike license or the creative commons 3.0 attribution noncommercial sharealike license some are copyright to the publisher but the author has the right to distribute them and has given arxiv a non exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them most are copyright to the author and arxiv has only a non exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them some authors have voiced concern over the lack of transparency in the arxiv academic peer review process demetris christopoulos from the national and kapodistrian university of athens likens arxiv to a non declared journal without a known editor in chief without a specific written policy regarding submitted papers and that applies hidden censorship to all papers that do not fall within established
