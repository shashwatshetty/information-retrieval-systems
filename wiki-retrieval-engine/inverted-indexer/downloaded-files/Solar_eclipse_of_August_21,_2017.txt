was also planned and took place to coincide with the eclipse logistical problems were expected with the influx of visitors especially for smaller communities the sale of counterfeit eclipse glasses was also anticipated to be a hazard for eye injuries future total solar eclipses will cross the united states in april 2024 12 states and august 2045 10 states and annular solar eclipses wherein the

duration of totality was 2 minutes 41.6 seconds at about in giant city state park just south of carbondale illinois and the greatest extent width was at near the village of cerulean kentucky located in between hopkinsville and princeton this was the first total solar eclipse visible from the southeastern united states since the solar eclipse of march 7 1970 two nasa wb-57f flew above the clouds prolonging the observation time spent in the umbra a partial solar eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the moon s penumbra including all of north america particularly areas just south of the totality pass where the eclipse lasted about 3 5 hours northern south america western europe and some of africa and north east asia at one location in wyoming a small group of astronomers used telescopic lenses to photograph the sun as it was in partial eclipse while the iss was also seen to briefly transit the sun similar images were captured by nasa from a location in washington see gallery partial eclipse section during totality stars and 4 planets were visible including regulus close to the sun mars was 8 degrees to the right and venus 34 degrees right mercury was 10 degrees

planets were visible the star system regulus was visible slightly to the west of the sun mars was 8 degrees to the right and venus 34 degrees right mercury was 10 degrees left and jupiter 51 degrees left this was the first total solar eclipse visible from the united states since that of july 11 1991 which was seen only from part of hawaii and the first visible from the contiguous united states since 1979 an eclipse of comparable length up to 3 minutes 8 seconds with the longest eclipse being 6 minutes and 54 seconds occurred over the contiguous united states on march 7 1970 along the southern portions of the eastern seaboard from florida to virginia the path of totality of the solar eclipse of february 26 1979 crossed only the states of washington oregon idaho montana and north dakota many enthusiasts traveled to the pacific northwest to view the eclipse since it would be the last chance to view such an eclipse in the contiguous united states for almost four decades the path of totality across the united states the august 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the pacific and atlantic coasts of the u s since 1918 also its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the united states making it the first such eclipse since the country s declaration of independence in 1776 prior to this the path of totality of the eclipse of june 13 1257 was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the united states the path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of april 8 2024 with the intersection of the two paths being in southern illinois in makanda township at cedar lake just south of carbondale an area of about 9,000 square miles including the cities of makanda carbondale cape girardeau missouri and paducah kentucky will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years the cities of benton carbondale chester harrisburg marion and metropolis in illinois cape girardeau farmington and perryville in missouri as well as paducah kentucky will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years the solar eclipse of august 12 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the u s to the 2017 eclipse about 400 km 250 mi to the southwest also crossing the pacific and atlantic coasts of the country however totality will be more than twice as long viewing the eclipse at oregon state university campers on a field near madras oregon three days before the eclipse

country in all regions east of the orange line on the map the eclipse was not visible in some locations in west africa and western north africa a partial eclipse was seen just before and during sunset the moon s umbra as seen from the international space station a large number of media outlets broadcast coverage of the eclipse including television and internet outlets nasa announced plans to offer streaming coverage through its nasa tv and nasa edge outlets using cameras stationed on the ground along the path of totality along with cameras on high altitude balloons jets and coverage from the international space station nasa stated that never before will a celestial event be viewed by so many and explored from so many vantage points from space from the air and from the ground abc cbs and nbc announced that they would respectively broadcast live television specials to cover the eclipse with correspondents stationed across the path of totality along with cnn fox news channel science and the weather channel the pbs series nova presented streaming coverage on facebook hosted by miles o brien and aired a special episode chronicling the event eclipse over america later in the day which marked the fastest production turnaround time in nova history other institutions and services also announced plans to stream their perspectives of the eclipse including the exploratorium in san francisco the elephant sanctuary of hohenwald tennessee the slooh robotic telescope app and the virtual telescope project the eclipse ballooning project a consortium of schools and colleges that sent 50 high altitude balloons into the sky during the eclipse to conduct experiments provided streams of footage and gps tracking of its launches contact with one balloon with 13,000 of scientific equipment launched under the aegis of the lgf museum of natural history near vale oregon was lost at 20,000 feet 6,100 m given that the balloon was believed to have burst at 100,000 feet 30,000 m it could have parachuted down anywhere from eastern oregon to caldwell idaho most likely to sun valley idaho a 1,000 reward is offered for its recovery the national solar observatory organized citizen cate volunteers to man 60 identical telescopes and instrumentation packages along the totality path to study changes in the corona over the duration of the eclipse in orbit the satellites lunar reconnaissance orbiter the international space station the solar dynamics observatory the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer solar and heliospheric observatory and hinode gathered data from the eclipse a viewing party was held at the white house during which president donald trump appeared on the truman balcony with first lady melania trump with the sun partially eclipsed president trump looked briefly in the general direction of the sun before using solar viewing glasses the rapper joey badass boasted of watching the solar eclipse without viewing glasses considering that our ancestors ain t have no fancy eyewear and they ain t all go blind unlike the us president he did not wear viewing glasses during the entire eclipse later he complained of vision problems and had to cancel his cleveland chicago toronto shows on the everybody tour due to unforeseen circumstances the eclipse generated reports of abnormal behavior in animal and plant life some farm animals including domestic chickens came out from under their coops and began grooming usually an evening activity horses also displayed increased whinnying running and jumping after the event cicadas were reported to grow louder before going silent during totality various birds were also observed flying in unusually large formations flowers such as the hibiscus closed their petals which typically happens at night before opening again after the solar event nasa reported over 90 million page views of the eclipse on its websites making it the agency s biggest online event ever beating the previous web traffic record about seven times over see also solar viewer in the months leading up to the eclipse many counterfeit glasses were put up for sale effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light but most uv and infrared light as well for visible light the user should only be able to see the sun sunglint reflected off shiny metal halogen bulbs the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs and similarly intense sources determining whether the glasses effectively block enough uv and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment the eye s retina lacks pain receptors and thus damage can occur without one s awareness the american astronomical society aas said products meeting the iso 12312-2 standard avoid risk to one s eyes and issued a list of reputable vendors of eclipse glasses the organization warned against products claiming iso certification or even citing the same number but not tested by an accredited laboratory another problem was counterfeits of reputable vendors products some even claiming the company s name such as with american paper optics which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits andrew lund the owner of a company which produces eclipse glasses noted that not all counterfeit glasses were necessarily unsafe he stated to quartz that the counterfeits he tested blocked the majority of harmful light spectrum concluding that the ip is getting ripped off but the good news is there are no long term harmful effects as one example the springdale library in metropolitan pittsburgh pennsylvania accidentally passed out dozens of pairs of counterfeit eclipse glasses but as of august 23 had not received any reports of eye damage on july 27 2017 amazon required all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information and proof of an accredited iso certification in mid august 2017 amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse viewing glasses that may not comply with industry standards and gave refunds to customers who had purchased them short term damage includes solar keratitis which is similar to sunburn of the cornea symptoms usually occur within twenty four hours and include eye pain and light sensitivity long term or permanent damage includes solar retinopathy which occurs when the sun burns a hole in the retina usually at the fovea the focus of the retina symptoms can occur as long as several weeks after the incident and can include loss of central vision and or other vision as well as eye pain and light sensitivity afterimages and changes in color vision depending on the severity of damage vision problems can last for several months or be permanent dr avnish deobhakta an ophthalmologist in new york states that if you re looking at the sun you re actually focusing intentionally the light of the sun onto the spot fovea where you want the most precise vision following a total eclipse in the united kingdom in 1999 at least 14 cases of permanent damage were confirmed one story of solar eclipse danger was illustrated by the case of mr tomososki who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse leaving him with a pea sized blind spot for the rest of his life during the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did while some can recover the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to not look at the sun a woman in her twenties severely and permanently damaged her vision by peeking at the 70 partial eclipse for a total of approximately six seconds the damage to one her retinas which was examined at the cellular level was surprisingly exactly concordant with the crescent shape of the eclipse itself lensrentals a camera rental company based in tennessee reported that many of its customers returned cameras and lenses with extensive damage the most common problem reported was damage to the camera s sensor this most often happens when shooting in live view mode where the sensor is continuously exposed to the eclipse image and becomes damaged by the sun s light another problem was the heat and brightness of the eclipse destroying the lens iris which mechanically regulates the amount of light that enters the camera another problem reported was one of a cinema camera s neutral density filter being damaged by the heat and light of the eclipse the cost of all of this damage likely amounted to thousands of dollars a message board on u s route 64 in north carolina alerting drivers of the eclipse officials inside and near the path of totality planned sometimes for years for the sudden influx of people smaller towns struggled to arrange viewing sites and logistics for what could have been a tourism boom or a disaster in the american west illegal camping was a major concern including near cities like jackson hole wyoming idaho s office of emergency management said idaho was a prime viewing state and advised jurisdictions to prepare for service load increases nearly every hotel and motel room campground and in some cases backyards for nearly 100 miles 160 km north and south of the path of totality had been reserved several months if not years in advance the state anticipated up to 500,000 visitors to join its 1.6 million residents oregon deployed six national guard aircraft and 150 soldiers because the influx of visitors coincided with the state s fire season hospital staffing and supplies of blood and anti snake bite antidote were augmented along the totality line also in oregon there were reports of hoteliers canceling existing reservations made at the regular market rate and increasing their rate sometimes threefold or more for guests staying to view the eclipse the oregon department of justice doj investigated various complaints and reached settlements with affected customers of at least 10 hotels in the state these settlements included refunds to the customers and fines paid to the doj although traffic to areas within the path of totality was somewhat spread out over the days prior to the eclipse there were widespread traffic problems across the united states after the event ended michael zeiler an eclipse cartographer had estimated that between 1.85 million and 7.4 million people would travel to the path of the eclipse in oregon an estimated one million people were expected to arrive that the oregon national guard was called in to help manage traffic in madras along us 26 and us 97 madras municipal airport received more than 400 mostly personal planes that queued for hours while waiting to leave after the eclipse officials in idaho where the totality path crossed the center of the state began planning for the eclipse a year in advance the state transportation department suspended construction projects along interstate 15 which traverses eastern idaho from august 18 22 in order to have all lanes open their counterparts in neighboring utah where many were expected to travel the 220 miles 350 km north via the highway from the salt lake city metropolitan area did the same on the morning of the eclipse many drivers left before dawn creating traffic volume along i-15 normally not seen until morning rush hour northbound traffic on the interstate in box elder county north of salt lake city slowed to 10 15 miles per hour 16 24 km h the idaho state police isp stationed a patrol car along i-15 every 15 miles 24 km between shelley and the utah border traffic backed up on i-15 us 26 south of idaho falls after the eclipse traffic more than doubled along i-15 southbound with extensive traffic jams continuing for eight hours as viewers who had traveled north into the totality path from utah returned there and to points south the isp tweeted a picture of bumper to bumper traffic stalled on the interstate just south of idaho falls motorists reported to local news outlets that it was taking them two hours to travel the 47 miles 76 km from that city to pocatello to the south a journey that normally takes 45 minutes others reported that it took three hours to travel from idaho falls to the closer city of blackfoot 30 miles 48 km farther north of pocatello in the rest of the state the impact was less severe traffic nearly doubled on us 93 and was up 55 percent on us 20 for some northbound travelers on i-15 the montana department of transportation had failed to make similar plans to those in idaho scheduling a road construction project to begin on august 21 that narrowed a section of the highway to a single northbound lane near the exit to clark canyon dam south of dillon though that stretch of highway generally has a traffic count of less than 1,000 vehicles per day on the day of the eclipse there were over a thousand vehicles per hour at peak times as a result traffic backed up as far as lima creating a delay of at least an hour for travelers heading northward further as construction had not yet begun drivers observed cones set up but no workers present on the road while the state traditionally halts construction projects during high traffic periods a state official admitted we probably made a bad mistake here in this regard traffic waiting to get on interstate 25 at glendo wyoming after the eclipse in wyoming estimates were that the population of the state officially 585,000 may have doubled or even tripled with traffic counts on show of august 21ing 536,000 more cars than the five year average for the third monday in august a 68 percent increase one official offered an estimate of two people in every car to arrive at a one million visitor figure and others noted that one million was a conservative estimate based on a one day traffic count of limited portions of major highways there were additional arrivals by aircraft plus travelers who arrived early or stayed for additional days two days before the eclipse traffic increased 18 percent over a five year average with an additional 131,000 vehicles on the road sunday saw an additional 217,000 vehicle increase following the eclipse more than 500,000 vehicles traveled wyoming roads creating large traffic jams particularly on southbound and eastbound highways drivers reported that it took up to 10 hours to travel 160 miles 260 km into northern colorado there was one traffic fatality and another fatality related to an off highway atv accident but in general there were far fewer incidents and traffic citations than authorities had anticipated in tennessee the knoxville news sentinel described the traffic problems created by the eclipse as the worst ever seen in that part of the state one backup along interstate 75 reached 34 miles 55 km in length between niota and the interstate 40 interchange at farragut a spokesman for the state s department of transportation allowed that the traffic jams were the worst he had seen in six and a half years on the job noting that accidents had aggravated the already heavy traffic flows attributed the i-75 congestion to knoxville area residents heading for the totality path at sweetwater and returning during what was the city s normal afternoon rush hour before the eclipse state officials had described their traffic expectations as equivalent to that generated by the bonnaroo music festival the twice a season nascar monster energy cup races at bristol or the formerly held boomsday fireworks festival maybe they should have considered a tsunami of traffic combining all three of those heavily attended events the news sentinel commented the tennessee highway patrol made sure that e very trooper not on sick leave or military leave or pre approved leave wa s working the day of the eclipse the state dot made sure its full complement of emergency aid help trucks were available as well alert signs on the highways also warned motorists not to pull over onto the shoulders to watch the eclipse as it could increase the risk of dangerous accidents and block the path of emergency vehicles in north carolina the department of transportation added cameras message boards and safety patrols in the counties where the total eclipse would take place as well as stopping road work the department warned that due to unprecedented traffic ordinary activities requiring driving might prove difficult and advised people to act as if there were snow in kentucky particularly around the hopkinsville area which was dubbed eclipseville usa post eclipse traffic caused extensive delays the en masse departure of tourists via interstate 69 as well as the western kentucky parkway resulted in commute times double or even triple of normal the hopkinsville to lexington commute under normal circumstances lasts three and a half hours an eclipse causes a reduction of solar power generation where the moon shadow covers any solar panel as do clouds the north american electric reliability corporation predicted minor impacts and attempted to measure the impact of the 2017 eclipse in california solar power was projected to decrease by 4 6,000 megawatts at 70 mw minute and then ramp up by 90 mw minute as the shadow passes caiso s typical ramp rate is 29 megawatts per minute around 4 gw mainly in north carolina and georgia were expected to be 90 percent obscured after the 2017 eclipse grid operators in california reported having lost 3,000 3,500 megawatts of utility scale solar power which was made up for by hydropower and gas reliably and as expected mimicking the usual duck curve energy demand management was also used to mitigate the solar drop nv energy prepared for the solar eclipse months in advance and collaborated with 17 western states when the eclipse began covering california with partial darkness which reduced its usual amount of solar generated electricity nv energy sent power there likewise when nevada received less sunlight other west coast states supplied electricity to it during the solar eclipse the state of nevada lost about 450 megawatts of electricity the amount used by about a quarter million typical residences the 2015 eclipse caused manageable solar power decreases in europe in germany solar power dropped from 14 gw to 7 gw of a 38 gw solar power capacity main article 2017 total solar eclipse stamp on june 20 2017 the usps released the first application of thermochromic ink
