on october 3 2005 with a magnitude of 0.958 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon s apparent diameter is smaller than the sun s blocking most of the sun s light and causing the sun to look like an annulus ring an annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the earth thousands of kilometres wide it was visible from a narrow corridor through the iberian peninsula and africa a partial eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the moon s penumbra including all of europe africa and southwestern asia the path of the eclipse began in the north atlantic ocean at 08 41 universal time ut the antumbra reached madrid spain at 08 56 ut lasting four minutes and eleven seconds and 90 of the sun was covered by the moon the antumbra reached algiers at 09 05 ut then passed through tunisia and libya before heading southeast through sudan kenya and somalia the shadow then moved out over the indian ocean until it terminated at sunset 12 22 ut the maximum eclipse duration occurred in central sudan at 10 31 42 ut where it lasted for 4m 31s when the sun was 71 above the horizon the theoretical maximum duration for a modern solar eclipse is 7 minutes 32 seconds the motion of the shadow was supersonic and it generated gravity waves that were detectable as disturbances in the ionosphere these gravity waves originate in the thermosphere at an altitude of about 180 km because of the obscuration of solar radiation the ionization level dropped by 70 during the eclipse the eclipse caused a 1 1.4 k drop in the temperature of the ionosphere contents chennai india partial animated path spain eclipse
