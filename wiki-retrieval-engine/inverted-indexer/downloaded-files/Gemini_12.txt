gemini vii veteran james a lovell the flight featured three periods of extravehicular activity eva by rookie edwin buzz aldrin lasting a total of 5 hours and 30 minutes it also achieved the fifth rendezvous and fourth docking with an agena target vehicle gemini xii marked a successful conclusion of the gemini program achieving the last of its goals by successfully demonstrating that astronauts can effectively work outside of spacecraft this was instrumental in paving the way for the apollo program to achieve its goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s contents position

all launch vehicle systems performed nominally during powered flight but at staging there was a recurrence of the first stage oxidizer tank rupture first seen on gemini 10 s launch on gemini 12 the fuel tank appeared to have also ruptured as a white cloud was seen emitting from the spent stage along with the orange nitrogen tetroxide another episode of green man also occurred at seco referring to pitch gyrations caused by pressure buildup in the second stage protective skirt the gemini 12 spacecraft and the agena photographed at 15 feet apart during docking gemini 12 tethered stationkeeping at the completion of the previous gemini flight the program still had not demonstrated that an astronaut could work easily and efficiently outside the spacecraft in preparation for gemini xii new improved restraints were added to the outside of the capsule and a new technique underwater training was introduced which would become a staple of future space walk simulation aldrin s two hour 20 minute tethered space walk during which he photographed star fields retrieved a micrometeorite collector and did other chores at last demonstrated the feasibility of extravehicular activity two more stand up evas also went smoothly as did the by now routine rendezvous and docking with an agena which was done manually using the onboard computer and charts when a rendezvous radar failed the climb to a higher orbit however was canceled because of a problem with the agena booster during orbital injection the gatv engine experienced a drop in turbopump speed lasting about 2.5 seconds after this pump performance returned to normal telemetry data indicated erratic pump speeds but engine performance did not reflect this ground controllers decided not to risk the planned orbital boost maneuver since the exact reason for the pump slowdown was unclear following gemini 12 s reentry and during the gatv s 63rd orbit they attempted to fire the propulsion system but a stuck fuel valve prevented engine start from occurring it was suspected that a turbopump bearing failure caused the anomalous conditions during orbital injection followed by heating and melting of pump components the inability of ground controllers to start the engine during the 63rd orbit was possibly due to melted or loose debris blocking the fuel valve and preventing its operation the telemetry data falsely reporting erratic pump speed was concluded to be debris being knocked around and affecting the data probes many documentaries afterward largely credit the spacewalk innovations including the underwater training to aldrin himself gemini 12 was designed to perform rendezvous and docking with the agena target vehicle to conduct three extra vehicular activity eva operations to conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise to perform docked maneuvers using the agena propulsion system to change orbit and demonstrate an automatic reentry gemini 12 agena info agena gatv-5001a nssdc id 1966-103a mass 3,175

reentered november 15 1966 when gemini 12 was being planned one of the possibilities raised was the potential for the flight to be run in conjunction with the first apollo mission which had been tentatively scheduled for the last quarter of 1966 by may 1966 delays in making apollo ready for flight just by itself and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the gemini made that impractical this became moot when slippage in readiness of the apollo spacecraft caused the last quarter 1966 target date to be missed and the apollo mission was rescheduled for february 21 1967
