minutes and 44 seconds thousands of people were able to witness the eclipse despite rain and overcast skies these identically scaled photos compare the apparent diameter of the full moon near apogee to the nearly new moon visible by earthshine on the day before the solar eclipse near lunar perigee this solar eclipse was the longest total solar eclipse to occur in the 21st century and will not be

duration was a result of the moon being near perigee with the apparent diameter of the moon 8 larger than the sun magnitude 1.080 and the earth being near aphelion where the sun appeared slightly smaller in contrast the annular solar eclipse of january 26 2009 occurred near lunar apogee and 7 smaller apparent diameter to the sun and the next solar eclipse of january 15 2010 was also annular
