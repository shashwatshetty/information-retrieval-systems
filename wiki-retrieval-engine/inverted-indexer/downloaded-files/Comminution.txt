from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search comminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size by crushing grinding cutting vibrating or other processes in geology it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the earth s crust in industry it is an important unit operation in mineral processing ceramics electronics and other fields accomplished with many types of mill in dentistry it is the result of mastication of food in general medicine it is one of the most traumatic forms of bone fracture within industrial uses the purpose of comminution is to reduce the size and to increase the surface area of solids it is also used to free useful materials from matrix materials in which they are embedded and to concentrate minerals contents the comminution of solid materials consumes energy which is being used to break up the solid into smaller pieces the comminution energy can be estimated by rittinger s law which assumes that the energy consumed is proportional to the newly generated surface area kick s law which related the energy to the sizes of the feed particles and the product particles bond s law which assumes that the total work useful in breakage is inversely proportional to the square root of the diameter of the product particles implying theoretically that the work input varies as the length of the new cracks made in breakage holmes s law which modifies bond s law by substituting the square root with an exponent that depends on the material there are three forces which typically are used to effect the comminution of particles impact shear and compression there are several methods of comminution comminution of solid materials requires different types of crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance the most common machines for the comminution of coarse feed material are the jaw crusher 1m p80 100 mm cone crusher p80 20 mm and hammer crusher primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges 100mm p80 20mm can be ground in autogenous or semi autogenous ag or sag mills depending on feed properties and application requirements for comminution of finer particle size ranges 20mm p80 30 m machines like the ball mill vertical roller mill hammer mill roller press or high compression roller mill vibration mill jet mill and others are used for yet finer grind sizes sometimes referred to as ultrafine grinding specialist mills such as the isamilltm are used trituration for instance is comminution or substance breakdown by rubbing trituration can further be described as levigation trituration of a powder with a non solvent liquid or pulverization by intervention which is trituration with a solvent that can be easily removed after the substance has been broken down mill grinding particle size distribution crusher v t e extractive metallurgy metallurgical assay non ferrous extractive metallurgy mineral processing by physical means extraction geological survey natural resources ore economic geology mineral base metal precious metal mining surface underground in hard rock underground in soft rock recycling scrap comminution stamp mill arrastra crusher ag mill sag mill pebble mill ball mill rod mill isamill sizing ore sorting vanning hydrocyclone trommel cyclonic separation mechanical screening concentration froth flotation jameson cell panning jig concentrators gravity concentration magnetic separation magnetation rocker box dry washing buddle pit pyrometallurgy by heat smelting iron smelting lead smelting zinc smelting flash smelting isasmelt furnace refractory linings refining cupellation parkes process bottom blown oxygen converter poling isakidd process other calcination roasting liquation hydrometallurgy by aqueous solution leaching lixiviant heap leaching dump leaching tank leaching in situ leaching gold chlorination gold cyanidation bayer process amalgamation patio process pan amalgamation electrometallurgy by electricity electrolysis electrowinning hall h roult process castner process co products tailings gangue slag clinker chat red mud stamp sand retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title comminution oldid 813412524 categories industrial processescomminution
