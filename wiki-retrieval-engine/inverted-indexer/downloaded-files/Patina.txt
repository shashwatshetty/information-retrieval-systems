that survived the firebombing from the original 18th century church pre colonial copper coin formerly used in the copper belt democratic republic of congo and zambia the external layer has been weathered by moisture and rain leading to the oxidation of copper patina or is a thin layer that variously forms on the surface of copper bronze and similar metals tarnish produced by oxidation or other chemical processes or certain stones and wooden furniture sheen produced by age wear and polishing or any similar acquired change of a surface through age and exposure additionally leather aficionados use the term to describe the ageing of high quality leather the patina on leather goods are unique to the type of leather and frequency of use and exposure patinas can provide a protective covering to materials that would otherwise be damaged by corrosion or weathering they may also be aesthetically appealing contents on metal patina is a coating of various chemical compounds such as oxides carbonates sulfides or sulfates formed on the surface during exposure to atmospheric elements oxygen rain acid rain carbon dioxide sulfur bearing compounds a common example of which is rust which forms on iron or steel when exposed to oxygen patina also refers to accumulated changes in surface texture and colour that result from normal use of an object such as a coin or a piece of furniture over time archaeologists also use the term patina to refer to a corticated layer that develops over time that is due to a range of complex factors on flint tools and ancient stone monuments this has led stone tool analysts in recent times to generally prefer the term cortification as a better term to describe the process than patination in geology and geomorphology the term patina is used to refer to discolored film or thin outer layer produced either on or within the surface of a rock or other material by either the development of a weathering rind within the surface of a rock the formation of desert varnish on the surface of a rock or combination of both it also refers to development as the result of weathering of a case hardened layer called cortex by geologists within the surface of either a flint or chert nodule the word patina comes from the latin for shallow dish figuratively patina can refer to any fading darkening or other signs of age which are felt to be natural or unavoidable or both the chemical process by which a patina forms or is deliberately induced is called patination and a work of art coated by a patina is said to be patinated copper weather vane with verdigris patina see natural copper patinas the statue of liberty gets its green color from the natural patina formed on its copper surface natural copper patina at the nordic embassies berlin the green patina that forms naturally on copper and bronze sometimes called verdigris usually consists of varying mixtures of copper chlorides sulfides sulfates and carbonates depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur containing acid rain in clean air rural environments the patina is created by the slow chemical reaction of copper with carbon dioxide and water producing a basic copper carbonate in industrial and urban air environments containing sulfurous acid rain from coal fired power plants or industrial processes the final patina is primarily composed of sulphide or sulphate compounds a patina layer takes many years to develop under natural weathering buildings in damp coastal marine environments will develop patina layers faster than ones in dry inland areas facade cladding copper cladding copper wall cladding with alloys of copper e g brass or bronze will weather differently from pure copper cladding even a lasting gold colour is possible with copper alloy cladding for example colston hall in bristol or the novotel at paddington central london often antique and well used firearms will develop a patina on the steel after the bluing parkerizing or other finish has worn firearms in this state are generally considered more valuable than ones that have been re blued or parkerized the patina protects the firearm from the more damaging rust that would occur were the patina to be polished off see chemically induced copper patinas artists and metalworkers often deliberately add patinas as a part of the original design and decoration of art and furniture or to simulate antiquity in newly made objects the process is often called distressing a wide range of chemicals both household and commercial can give a variety of patinas they are often used by artists as surface embellishments either for color texture or both patination composition varies with the reacted elements and these will determine the color of the patina for copper alloys such as bronze exposure to chlorides leads to green while sulfur compounds such as liver of sulfur tend to brown the basic palette for patinas on copper alloys includes chemicals like ammonium sulfide blue black liver of sulfur brown black cupric nitrate blue green and ferric nitrate yellow brown for artworks patination is often deliberately accelerated by applying chemicals with heat colors range from matte sandstone yellow to deep blues greens whites reds and various blacks some patina colors are achieved by the mixing of colors from the reaction with the metal surface with pigments added to the chemicals sometimes the surface is enhanced by waxing oiling or other types of lacquers or clear coats more simply the french sculptor auguste rodin used to instruct assistants at his studio to urinate over bronzes stored in the outside yard a patina can be produced on copper by the application of vinegar acetic acid this patina is water soluble and will not last on the outside of a building like a true patina it is usually used as pigment patina is also found on slip rings and commutators this type of patina is formed by corrosion what elements the air might hold residue from the wear of the carbon brush and moisture thus the patina needs special conditions to work as intended patinas can also be found in woks or other metal baking dishes which form when properly seasoned the patina on a wok is a dark coating of oils that have been burned onto it to prevent food sticking and to enhance the flavor of the foods cooked in it steaming foods or using soap on a wok or other dishware could damage the patina and possibly allow rust knife collectors that own carbon steel blades sometimes force a patina onto the blade to help protect it and give it a more personalized look this can be done using various chemicals and substances such as muriatic acid apple cider vinegar or mustard it can also be done by sticking the blade into any acidic vegetable or fruit such as an orange or an apple the admiralty brass statue of joseph i of portugal in commerce square lisbon with a surface layer of green patina caused by advanced oxidation 2011 the same statue in 2015 after removal of the patina 2012 13 showing the original 1775 finish the dark colour of the statue made english sailors call the square that houses it black horse square in the case of antiques a range of views are held on the value of patination and its replacement if damaged known as repatination preserving a piece s look and character is important and removal or reduction may dramatically reduce its value if patination has flaked off repatination may be recommended appraiser reyne haines notes that a repatinated metal piece will be worth more than one with major imperfections in the patina but less than a
