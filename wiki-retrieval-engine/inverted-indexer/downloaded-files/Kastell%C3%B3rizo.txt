the island s official name megisti means biggest or greatest but at only 11.98 km2 4.626 sq mi in area it is the smallest of the dodecanese the name however refers to the fact that it is the largest of the small archipelago this name was used in antiquity but is now rarely used in greek the name kastell rizo being common since the twelfth century there are several hypotheses about the origin of this name kastello derives from the italian word castello meaning castle there is some argument on the second part of the name the arguments are centered on the following possible origins of the element rizo rizo being derived from the italian word rosso meaning red either from the reddish color of the rocks of the island or from the reddish color of the castle at sunset or from the color of the coat of arms of the great master of the knights of rhodes juan fernandez de heredia which stood above the gate of the castle these arguments are widely discredited as the rocks on the island do not contain any red pigment and the name kastellorizo predates the arrival of the knights rizo being a corruption of the word rhoge one of the ancient appellations of the nearby island of ro if this is correct the island s modern name is actually an amalgam of the separate island names castello and rhoge rizo being the actual greek word rizon meaning root as researched by greek historian i m hatzifotis 1996 to signify the foothill or rizovouno on which the island s original castle was built it has gone by several different names in its history including kastellorizo greek castellorizo
