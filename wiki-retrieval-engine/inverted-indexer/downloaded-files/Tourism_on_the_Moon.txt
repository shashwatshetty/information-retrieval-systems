from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the moon lunar tourism may be possible in the future if trips to the moon are made affordable to the public some space tourism startup companies are planning to offer tourism on or around the moon and estimate this to be possible sometime between 2018 and 2043 contents space tourism companies which have announced they are pursuing lunar tourism include space adventures excalibur almaz virgin galactic and spacex sketch of circumlunar free return trajectory tourist flights would be of three types flyby in a circumlunar trajectory lunar orbit and lunar landing some of the space tourism start up companies have declared their cost for each tourist for a tour to the moon circumlunar flyby space adventures is charging 150 million per seat a price that includes months of ground based training although this is only a fly by mission and will not land on the moon excalibur almaz had the same price tag but never managed to send their capsule to space lunar orbit lunar landing the golden spike company was planning to charge 750 million per seat for future lunar landing tourism earthrise over the lunar horizon as seen from

base has been determined to have cultural and historic significance by the u s states of california and new mexico which have listed it on their heritage registers since their laws require only that listed sites have some association with the state despite the location of mission control in houston texas has not granted similar status to the site as its historic preservation laws limit such designations to properties located within the state the u s national park service has declined to grant it national historic landmark status because the outer space treaty prohibits any nation from claiming sovereignty over any extraterrestrial body it has not been proposed as a world heritage site since the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco which oversees that program limits nations to submitting sites within their own borders interest in affording historical lunar landing sites some formal protection grew in the early 21st century with the announcement of the google lunar x prize for private corporations to successfully build spacecraft and reach the moon a 1 million bonus was offered for any competitor that visited a historic site on the moon one team led by astrobotic technology announced it would attempt to land a craft at tranquility base although it canceled those plans the ensuing controversy led nasa to request that any other missions to the moon private or governmental human or robotic keep a distance of at least 75 meters 246 ft from the site the company space adventures has announced a planned mission titled dse alpha to take two tourists within 100 kilometers 54 nautical miles of the lunar surface using a soyuz spacecraft piloted by a professional cosmonaut the trip would last around a week excalibur almaz proposed to take three tourists in a flyby around the moon using modified almaz space station modules in a low energy trajectory flyby around the moon the trip would last around 6 months however their equipment was never launched and is to be converted into an educational exhibit in february 2017 spacex announced it had accepted deposits for a week long flyby mission to the moon set for late 2018
