connection between the black and aegean seas through the bosphorus and dardanelles straits and separates anatolia from thrace on the european mainland traditionally anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the gulf of alexandretta and the black sea to the armenian highlands armenia major this region is now named and largely situated in the eastern anatolia region of the far north east of turkey and converges with the lesser caucasus an area that was incorporated in the russian empire region of transcaucasia in the 19th century thus traditionally anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two thirds of the asian part of turkey anatolia is often considered to be synonymous with asian turkey which comprises almost the entire country its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the turkish borders with neighboring georgia armenia azerbaijan iran iraq and syria in clockwise direction the ancient inhabitants of anatolia spoke the now extinct anatolian languages which were largely replaced by the greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the hellenistic roman and byzantine periods major anatolian languages included hittite luwian and lydian among other more poorly attested relatives the turkification of anatolia began under the seljuk empire in the late 11th century and continued under the ottoman empire between the early 14th and early 20th centuries however various non turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in anatolia today including kurdish neo aramaic armenian arabic laz

anatolian peninsula also called asia minor is bounded by the black sea to the north the mediterranean sea to the south the aegean sea to the west and the sea of marmara to the northwest which separates anatolia from thrace in europe traditionally anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the gulf of alexandretta to the black sea coterminous with the anatolian plateau this traditional geographical definition is used for example in the latest edition of merriam webster s geographical dictionary as well as the archeological community under this definition anatolia is bounded to the east by the armenian highlands and the euphrates before that river bends to the southeast to enter mesopotamia to the southeast it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the orontes valley in syria region and the mesopotamian plain following the armenian genocide and establishment of the republic of turkey the armenian highlands or western armenia were renamed eastern anatolia literally the eastern east by the turkish government being effectively co terminous with asian turkey turkey s first geography congress in 1941 created two regions to the east of the gulf of iskenderun black sea line named the eastern anatolia region and the southeastern anatolia region the former largely corresponding to the western part of the armenian highland the latter to the northern part of the mesopotamian plain this wider definition of anatolia has gained widespread currency outside of turkey and has for instance been adopted by encyclop dia britannica and other encyclopedic and general reference publications vazken davidian terms the expanded use of anatolia to apply to territory formerly referred to as armenia as an historical imposition and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with referring to the ottoman east as eastern anatolia the oldest known reference to anatolia as land of the hatti appears on mesopotamian cuneiform tablets from the period of the akkadian empire 2350 2150 bc the first recorded name the greeks used for the anatolian peninsula as a presumably echoed the name of the assuwa league in western anatolia

2012 human habitation in anatolia dates back to the paleolithic neolithic anatolia has been proposed as the homeland of the indo european language family although linguists tend to favour a later origin in the steppes north of the black sea however it is clear that the anatolian languages the oldest attested branch of indo european have been spoken in anatolia since at least the 19th century bc the earliest historical records of anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the mesopotamian based akkadian empire during the reign of sargon of akkad in the 24th century bc scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of anatolia were the hattians and hurrians the hattians spoke a language of unclear affiliation and the hurrian language belongs to a small family called hurro urartian all these languages now being extinct relationships with indigenous languages of the caucasus have been proposed but are not generally accepted the region was famous for exporting raw materials and areas of hattian and hurrian populated southeast anatolia were colonised by the akkadians after the fall of the akkadian empire in the mid-21st century bc the assyrians who were the northern branch of the akkadian people colonised parts of the region between the 21st and mid-18th centuries bc and claimed its resources notably silver one of the numerous cuneiform records dated circa 20th century bc found in anatolia at the assyrian colony of kanesh uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines main article history of the hittites the lion gate at hattusa capital of the hittite empire the city s history dates to before 2000 bc unlike the akkadians and their descendants the assyrians whose anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in mesopotamia the hittites were centred at hattusa modern bo azkale in north central anatolia by the 17th century bc they were speakers of an indo european language the hittite language or nesili the language of nesa in hittite attested for the first time in the assyrian tablets of nesa around 2000bc they conquered hattusa in the 18th century bc imposing themselves over hattian and hurrian speaking populations according to the widely accepted kurgan theory on the proto indo european homeland however the hittites along with the other indo european ancient anatolians were themselves relatively recent immigrants to anatolia from the north the hittites adopted the cuneiform script invented in mesopotamia during the late bronze age circa 1650 bc they created a kingdom the hittite new kingdom which became an empire in the 14th century bc after the conquest of kizzuwatna in the south east and the defeat of the assuwa league in western anatolia the empire reached its height in the 13th century bc controlling much of asia minor northwestern syria and northwest upper mesopotamia they failed to reach the anatolian coasts of the black sea however as a non indo european people the semi nomadic pastoralist and tribal kaskians had established themselves there displacing earlier palaic speaking indo europeans much of the history of the hittite empire concerned war with the rival empires of egypt assyria and the mitanni the egyptians eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the hittites and becoming wary of the power of assyria which had destroyed the mitanni empire the assyrians and hittites were then left to battle over control of eastern and southern anatolia and colonial territories in syria the assyrians had better success than the egyptians annexing much hittite and hurrian territory in these regions after 1180 bc during the late bronze age collapse the hittite empire disintegrated into several independent syro hittite states subsequent to losing much territory to the middle assyrian empire and being finally overrun by the phrygians another indo european people who are believed to have migrated from the balkans the phrygian expansion into southeast anatolia was eventually halted by the assyrians who controlled that region arameans arameans encroached over the borders of south central anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the hittite empire and some of the syro hittite states in this region became an amalgam of hittites and arameans these became known as syro hittite states luwians lycian rock cut tombs of kaunos dalyan in central and western anatolia another indo european people the luwians came to the fore circa 2000 bc their language was closely related to hittite the general consensus amongst scholars is that luwian was spoken to a greater or lesser degree across a large area of western anatolia including possibly wilusa troy the seha river land to be identified with the hermos and or kaikos valley and the kingdom of mira kuwaliya with its core territory of the maeander valley from the 9th century bc luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as lydia caria and lycia all of which had hellenic influence from the 10th to late 7th centuries bc much of anatolia particularly the east central and southeastern regions fell to the neo assyrian empire including all of the syro hittite states tabal kingdom of commagene the cimmerians and scythians and swathes of cappadocia the neo assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by medes persians scythians and their own babylonian relations the last assyrian city to fall was harran in southeast anatolia this city was the birthplace of the last king of babylon the assyrian nabonidus and his son and regent belshazzar much of the region then fell to the short lived iran based median empire with the babylonians and scythians briefly appropriating some territory from the late 8th century bc a new wave of indo european speaking raiders entered northern and northeast anatolia the cimmerians and scythians the cimmerians overran phrygia and the scythians threatened to do the same to urartu and lydia before both were finally checked by the assyrians the north western coast of anatolia was inhabited by greeks of the achaean mycenaean culture from the 20th century bc related to the greeks of south eastern europe and the aegean beginning with the bronze age collapse at the end of the 2nd millennium bc the west coast of anatolia was settled by ionian greeks usurping the area of the related but earlier mycenaean greeks over several centuries numerous ancient greek city states were established on the coasts of anatolia greeks started western philosophy on the western coast of anatolia pre socratic philosophy ancient regions of anatolia 500 bc asia minor in the greco roman period the classical regions and their main settlements asia minor in the early 2nd century ad the roman provinces under trajan the temple of athena funded by alexander the great in the ancient greek city of priene in classical antiquity anatolia was described by herodotus and later historians as divided into regions named after tribes such as lydia lycia caria mysia bithynia phrygia galatia lycaonia pisidia paphlagonia cilicia and cappadocia by that time the populations were a mixture of the ancient anatolian or syro hittite substrate and post bronze age collapse thraco phrygian and more recent greco macedonian incursions the dying galatian was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230 220 bc by king attalos i of pergamon to honor his victory over the celtic galatians in anatolia anatolia is known as the birthplace of minted coinage as opposed to unminted coinage which first appears in mesopotamia at a much earlier date as a medium of exchange some time in the 7th century bc in lydia the use of minted coins continued to flourish during the greek and roman eras during the 6th century bc all of anatolia was conquered by the persian achaemenid empire the persians having usurped the medes as the dominant dynasty in iran in 499 bc the ionian city states on the west coast of anatolia rebelled against persian rule the ionian revolt as it became known though quelled initiated the greco persian wars which ended in a greek victory in 449 bc and the ionian cities regained their independence alongside the withdrawal of the persian forces from their european territories in 334 bc the macedonian greek king alexander the great conquered the peninsula from the achaemenid persian empire alexander s conquest opened up the interior of asia minor to greek settlement and influence sanctuary of commagene kings on mount nemrut 1st century bc following the death of alexander and the breakup of his empire anatolia was ruled by a series of hellenistic kingdoms such as the attalids of pergamum and the seleucids the latter controlling most of anatolia a period of peaceful hellenization followed such that the local anatolian languages had been supplanted by greek by the 1st century bc in 133 bc the last attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the roman republic and western and central anatolia came under roman control but hellenistic culture remained predominant further annexations by rome in particular of the kingdom of pontus by pompey brought all of anatolia under roman control except for the eastern frontier with the parthian empire which remained unstable for centuries causing a series of wars culminating in the roman parthian wars after the division of the roman empire anatolia became part of the east roman or byzantine empire anatolia was one of the first places where christianity spread so that by the 4th century ad western and central anatolia were overwhelmingly christian and greek speaking for the next 600 years while imperial possessions in europe were subjected to barbarian invasions anatolia would be the center of the hellenic world byzantine control was challenged by arab raids starting in the eighth century see arab byzantine wars but in the ninth and tenth century a resurgent byzantine empire regained its lost territories including even long lost territory such as armenia and syria ancient aram byzantine anatolia and the byzantine arab frontier zone in the mid-9th century beyliks and other states around anatolia c 1300 in the 10 years following the battle of manzikert in 1071 the seljuk turks from central asia migrated over large areas of anatolia with particular concentrations around the northwestern rim the turkish language and the islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the seljuk conquest and this period marks the start of anatolia s slow transition from predominantly christian and greek speaking to predominantly muslim and turkish speaking although ethnic groups such as armenians greeks and assyrians remained numerous and retained christianity and their native languages in the following century the byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern anatolia control of anatolia was then split between the byzantine empire and the seljuk sultanate of r m with the byzantine holdings gradually being reduced in 1255 the mongols swept through eastern and central anatolia and would remain until 1335 the ilkhanate garrison was stationed near ankara after the decline of the ilkhanate from 1335 1353 the mongol empire s legacy in the region was the uyghur eretna dynasty that was overthrown by kadi burhan al din in 1381 by the end of the 14th century most of anatolia was controlled by various anatolian beyliks smyrna fell in 1330 and the last byzantine stronghold in anatolia philadelphia fell in 1390 the turkmen beyliks were under the control of the mongols at least nominally through declining seljuk sultans the beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the mongol ilkhanids the osmanli ruler osman i was the first turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s for it bears the legend minted by osman son of ertugul since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in islamic practice only to a sovereign it can be considered that the osmanli or ottoman turks became formally independent from the mongol khans among the turkish leaders the ottomans emerged as great power under osman i and his son orhan i the anatolian beyliks were successively absorbed into the rising ottoman empire during the 15th century it is not well understood how the osmanl or ottoman turks came to dominate their neighbours as the history of medieval anatolia is still little known the ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of halicarnassus modern bodrum from the knights of saint john ethnographic map of anatolia from 1911 with the acceleration of the decline of the ottoman empire in the early 19th century and as a result of the expansionist policies of czarist russia in the caucasus many muslim nations and groups in that region mainly circassians tatars azeris lezgis chechens and several turkic groups left their homelands and settled in anatolia as the ottoman empire further shrank in the balkan regions and then fragmented during the balkan wars much of the non christian populations of its former possessions mainly balkan muslims bosnian muslims albanians turks muslim bulgarians and greek muslims such as the vallahades from greek macedonia were resettled in various parts of anatolia mostly in formerly christian villages throughout anatolia a continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century when greeks from anatolia constantinople and pontus area migrated toward the newly independent kingdom of greece and also towards the united states southern part of the russian empire latin america and rest of europe following the russo persian treaty of turkmenchay 1828 and the incorporation of the eastern armenia into the russian empire another migration involved the large armenian population of anatolia which recorded significant migration rates from western armenia eastern anatolia toward the russian empire especially toward its newly established armenian provinces anatolia remained multi ethnic until the early 20th century see the rise of nationalism under the ottoman empire during world war i the armenian genocide the greek genocide especially in pontus and the assyrian genocide almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of armenian greek and assyrian populations in anatolia and surrounding regions following the greco turkish war of 1919 1922 most remaining ethnic anatolian greeks were forced out during the 1923 population exchange between greece and turkey many more have left turkey since leaving fewer than 5,000 greeks in anatolia today since the foundation of the republic of turkey in 1923
