kingdom of dahomey kingdom of whydah first franco dahomean war second franco dahomean war french dahomey republic of dahomey people s republic of benin republic of benin benin portal v t e main article history of benin the current country of benin combines three areas which had distinctly different political systems and ethnicities prior to french colonial control before 1700 there were a few important city states along the coast primarily of the aja ethnic group but also including yoruba and gbe peoples and a mass of tribal regions inland composed of bariba mahi gedevi and kabye peoples the oyo empire located primarily to the east of modern benin was the most significant large scale military force in the region it regularly conducted raids and exacted tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions the situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the kingdom of dahomey comprised mostly of fon people was founded on the abomey plateau and began taking over areas along the coast by 1727 king agaja of the kingdom of dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of allada and whydah but it had become a tributary of the oyo empire and did not directly attack the oyo allied city state of porto novo the rise of the kingdom of dahomey the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of porto novo and the continued tribal politics of the northern region persisted into the colonial and post colonial periods the dahomey kingdom was known for its culture and traditions young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers and taught the kingdom s military customs until they were old enough to join the army dahomey was also famous for instituting an elite female soldier corps called ahosi i e the king s wives or mino our mothers in the fon language fongbe and known by many europeans as the dahomean amazons this emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned dahomey the nickname of black sparta from european observers and 19th century explorers such as sir richard burton map of the kingdom of dahomey 1793 the kings of dahomey sold their war captives into transatlantic slavery they also had a practice of killing war captives in a ceremony known as the annual customs by about 1750 the king of dahomey was earning an estimated 250,000 per year by selling african captives to european slave traders though the leaders of dahomey appear to have initially resisted the slave trade it flourished in the region of dahomey for almost three hundred years beginning in 1472 with a trade agreement with portuguese merchants the area was named the slave coast because of this flourishing trade court protocols which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom s many battles be decapitated decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area the number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per decade by the 1860s dahomey amazons with the king at their head going to war 1793 the decline was partly due to the banning of the trans atlantic slave trade by britain and the united states in 1808 followed by other countries this decline continued until 1885 when the last slave ship departed from the coast of the present day benin republic bound for brazil in south america which had yet to abolish slavery the capital s name porto novo is of portuguese origin meaning new port it was originally developed as a port for the slave trade by the middle of the nineteenth century dahomey had begun to weaken and lose its status as the regional power this enabled the french to take over the area in 1892 in 1899 the french included the land called french dahomey within the larger french west africa colonial region in 1958 france granted autonomy to the republic of dahomey and full independence on 1 august 1960 the president who led the country to independence was hubert maga for the next twelve years after 1960 ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence there were
