mount athos byzantine christians eastern christians who follow the rite of constantinople orthodox christians and greek catholics call this day great and holy friday or simply great friday because the sacrifice of jesus through his crucifixion is commemorated on this day the divine liturgy the sacrifice of bread and wine is never celebrated on great friday except when this day coincides with the great feast of the annunciation which falls on the fixed date of 25 march for those churches which follow the traditional julian calendar 25 march currently falls on 7 april of the modern gregorian calendar also on great friday the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout great lent but instead don black vestments there is no stripping of the altar on holy and great thursday as in the west instead all of the church hangings are changed to black and will remain so until the divine liturgy on great saturday the faithful revisit the events of the day through public reading of specific psalms and the gospels and singing hymns about christ s death rich visual imagery and symbolism as well as stirring hymnody are remarkable elements of these observances in the orthodox understanding the events of holy week are not simply an annual commemoration of past events but the faithful actually participate in the death and resurrection of jesus each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the savior and the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the savior the holy church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the garden of gethsemane up to the crucifixion on golgotha taking us back through the past centuries in thought the holy church brings us to the foot of the cross of christ erected on golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the savior great and holy friday is observed as a strict fast and adult byzantine christians are expected to abstain from all food and drink the entire day to the extent that their health permits on this holy day neither a meal is offered nor do we eat on this day of the crucifixion if someone is unable or has become very old or is unable to fast he may be given bread and water after sunset in this way we come to the holy commandment of the holy apostles not to eat on

about the crucifixion at each of the hours some of the material from the previous night is repeated this is somewhat more festive in character and derives its name of royal from both the fact that the hours are served with more solemnity than normal commemorating christ the king who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the emperor and his court the crucified christ just before the deposition from the cross and the placing of the epitaphios in the sepulcher in the afternoon around 3 pm all gather for the vespers of the

consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of psalm 119 which is by far the longest psalm in the bible the enk mia are the best loved hymns of byzantine hymnography both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day they consist of 185 tercet antiphons arranged in three parts st seis or stops which are interjected with the verses of psalm 119 and nine short doxastik gloriae and theot kia invocations to the virgin mary the three st seis are each set to its own music and are commonly known by their initial antiphons

myrrh is fitting for the dead but christ has shown himself a stranger to corruption crucifix prepared for veneration the catholic church regards good friday and holy saturday as the paschal fast in accord with article 110 of sacrosanctum concilium in the latin church a fast day is understood as having only one full meal and two collations a smaller repast the two of which together do not equal the one full meal although this may be observed less stringently on holy saturday than on good friday and on which the faithful abstain from eating meat this is why many places have the typical fish friday in countries where good friday is not a day of rest from work the afternoon liturgical service is usually put off until a few hours after the recommended time of 3 pm the roman rite has no celebration of mass between the lord s supper on holy thursday evening and the easter vigil unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the vatican or the local bishop the only sacraments celebrated during this time are baptism for those in danger of death penance and anointing of the sick while there is no celebration of the eucharist it is distributed to the faithful only in the service of the passion of the lord but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this service during this period crosses candlesticks and altar cloths are

communion from the blessed sacrament on good friday our lady of lourdes philadelphia the good friday liturgy consists of three parts the liturgy of the word the veneration of the cross and holy communion the liturgy of the word consists of the clergy and assisting ministers entering in complete silence without any singing they then silently make a full prostration signifying the abasement of earthly man it also symbolizes the grief and sorrow of the church then follows the collect prayer and the reading or chanting of isaiah 52 13 53 12 hebrews 4 14 16 5 7 9 and the passion account from the gospel of john traditionally divided between three deacons yet usually divided between the celebrant one or two singers or readers and the congregation which speaks the part of the crowd this part of the liturgy concludes with the orationes sollemnes a series of prayers for the church the pope the clergy and laity of the church those preparing for baptism the unity of christians the jewish people those who do not believe in christ those who do not believe in god those in public office those in special need after each prayer intention the deacon calls the faithful to kneel for a short period of private prayer the celebrant then sums up the prayer intention with a collect style prayer the adoration of the cross has a crucifix not necessarily the one that is normally on or near the altar at other times of the year solemnly unveiled and displayed to the congregation and then venerated by them individually if possible and usually by kissing the wood of the cross while hymns and the improperia reproaches with the trisagion hymn are chanted holy communion is done according to a rite based on that of the final part of mass beginning with the our father but omitting the ceremony of breaking of the bread and its related chant the agnus dei the eucharist consecrated at the evening mass of the lord s supper on holy thursday is distributed at this service before the reform of pope pius xii only the priest received communion in the framework of what was called the mass of the presanctified which included the usual offertory prayers with the placing of wine in the chalice but which omitted the canon of the mass the priest and people then depart in silence and the altar cloth is removed leaving the altar bare except for the crucifix and two or four candlesticks the way of the cross celebrated at the colosseum in rome on good friday rome canopy erected at the temple of venus and rome during the way of the cross ceremony in addition to the prescribed liturgical service the stations of the cross are often prayed either in the church or outside and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00 pm known as the three hours agony in countries such as malta italy philippines puerto rico and spain processions with statues representing the passion of christ are held in rome since the papacy of saint john paul ii the heights of the temple of venus and roma and their position opposite the main entrance to the colosseum have been used to good effect as a public address platform this may be seen in the photograph below where a red canopy has been erected to shelter the pope as well as an illuminated cross on the occasion of the way of the cross ceremony the pope either personally or through a representative leads the faithful through meditations on the stations of the cross while a cross is carried from there to the colosseum in polish churches a tableau of christ s tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the tomb where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the lord s body a life size figure of jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful especially on holy saturday the tableaux may include flowers candles figures of angels standing watch and the three crosses atop mt calvary and much more each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the blessed sacrament draped in a filmy veil is prominently displayed main article acts of reparation to jesus christ el greco s jesus carrying the cross 1580 the roman catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation for the sufferings and insults that jesus suffered during his passion on good friday these acts of reparation to jesus christ do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary but aim to repair the sins against jesus some such prayers are provided in the raccolta catholic prayer book approved by a decree of 1854 and published by the holy see in 1898 which also includes prayers as acts of reparation to the virgin mary in his encyclical miserentissimus redemptor on reparations pope pius xi called acts of reparation to jesus christ a duty for catholics and referred to them as some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury with respect to the sufferings of jesus pope john paul ii referred to acts of reparation as the unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the son of god continues to be crucified the 1662 book of common prayer did not specify a particular rite to be observed on good friday but local custom came to mandate an assortment of services including the seven last words from the cross and a three hour service consisting of matins ante communion using the reserved sacrament in high church parishes and evensong in recent times revised editions of the prayer book and common worship have re introduced pre reformation forms of observance of good friday corresponding to those in today s roman catholic church with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the church of england prior to the henrican edwardian and elizabethan reforms including creeping to the cross in lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century good friday was the most important religious holiday and abstention from all worldly works was expected during that time lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the eucharist on good friday on the contrary it was a prime day on which to receive the eucharist and services were often accentuated by special music such as the st matthew passion by johann sebastian bach more recently lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured good friday as part of the larger sweep of the great three days maundy thursday good friday and the vigil of easter the three days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of jesus as part of the liturgy of the three days lutherans generally fast from the eucharist on good friday rather it is celebrated in remembrance of the last supper on maundy thursday and at the vigil of easter one practice among lutheran churches is to celebrate a tenebrae service on good friday typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels while being called tenebrae it holds little resemblance to the now suppressed catholic monastic rite of the same name the good friday liturgy appointed in evangelical lutheran worship the worship book of the evangelical lutheran church in america specifies a liturgy similar to the revised roman catholic liturgy a rite for adoration of the crucified christ includes the optional singing of the solemn reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti jewish overtones in previous versions influenced by the ecumenical liturgical renewal movement and in an attempt to recover patterns of worship from the early church many lutheran congregations are moving away from long preaching services centered on a dramatic and sentimentalized remembrance of the seven last words sayings of jesus assembled from the four gospels toward a more devotional practice that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross and a singular biblical account of the passion narrative from the gospel of john along with observing a general lenten fast many lutherans emphasize the importance of good friday as a day of fasting within the kalendar a handbook for the discipline of lent recommends the lutheran guideline to fast on ash wednesday and good friday with only one simple meal during the day usually without meat many other mainstream protestant communities hold special services on this day as well moravians hold a lovefeast on good friday as they receive holy communion on maundy thursday the methodist church commemorates good friday with fasting as well as a service of worship often based on the seven last words from the cross it is not uncommon for some communities to hold interdenominational services on good friday in the reformed tradition good friday is one of the evangelical feasts and is thus widely observed with church

employees a paid day off when that day is a religious holiday including good friday but only so long as the state can provide a valid secular purpose that coincides with the obvious religious purpose

2030 19 april 26 april good friday is the friday before easter which is calculated differently in eastern christianity and western christianity see computus for details easter falls on the first sunday following the paschal full moon the full moon on or after 21 march taken to be the date of the vernal equinox the western calculation uses the gregorian calendar while the eastern calculation uses the julian calendar whose 21 march now corresponds to the gregorian calendar s 3 april the calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ see computus in eastern christianity easter can fall between 22 march and 25 april on julian calendar thus between 4 april and 8 may in terms of the gregorian calendar during the period 1900 and 2099 so good friday can fall between 20 march and 23 april inclusive or between 2 april and 6 may in terms of the gregorian calendar good friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of richard wagner s music drama parsifal which contains an orchestral interlude known as the good friday music some baptist congregations the philadelphia church of god and some non denominational churches oppose the observance of good friday regarding it as a papist tradition and instead observe the crucifixion on wednesday to coincide with the jewish sacrifice of the passover lamb which christians believe is an old testament pointer to jesus christ a wednesday crucifixion of jesus allows for him to be in the tomb heart of the earth for three days and three nights as he told the pharisees he would be matthew 12 40 rather than two nights and a day by inclusive counting as was the norm at that time if he had died on a friday preparation day 14 nisan on the hebrew calendar which is the day before passover 15 nisan instead of the friday morning as the synoptic gospels refer to the sabbath and they believe this refers to a high sabbath which occurs on feast days and not the ordinary weekly sabbath ascension of jesus divine
