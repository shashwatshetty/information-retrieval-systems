100 km 62 mi is shown the layers of the atmosphere are drawn to scale whereas objects within them such as the international space station are not outer space or just space is the expanse that exists beyond the earth and between celestial bodies outer space is not completely empty it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation magnetic fields neutrinos dust and cosmic rays the baseline temperature as set by the background radiation from the big bang is 2.7 kelvins k 270.45 c 454.81 f the plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic ordinary matter in the universe it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into stars and galaxies studies indicate that 90 of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form called dark matter which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces observations suggest that the majority of the mass energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space there is no definite altitude above the earth s surface where outer space begins however the k rm n line at an altitude of 100 km 62 mi above sea level is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping the framework for international space law was established by the outer space treaty which entered into force on 10 october 1967 this treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space despite the drafting of un resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space anti satellite weapons have been tested in earth orbit humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high altitude balloon flights followed by manned rocket launches earth orbit was first achieved by yuri gagarin of the soviet union in 1961 and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the solar system due to the high cost of getting into space manned spaceflight has been limited to low earth orbit and the moon outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the dual hazards of vacuum and radiation microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss in addition to these health and environmental issues the economic cost of putting objects including humans into space is very high contents in 350 bce greek philosopher aristotle suggested that nature abhors a vacuum a principle that became known as the horror vacui this concept built upon a 5th century bce ontological argument by the greek philosopher parmenides who denied the possible existence of a void in space based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist in the west it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty as late as the 17th century the french philosopher ren descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled in ancient china the 2nd century astronomer zhang heng became convinced that space must be infinite extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the sun and the stars the surviving books of the hs an yeh school said that the heavens were boundless empty and void of substance likewise the sun moon and the company of stars float in the empty space moving or standing still the italian scientist galileo galilei knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity in 1640 he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum however it would remain for his pupil evangelista torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643 this experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in europe the french mathematician blaise pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower in 1648 his brother in law florin p rier repeated the experiment on the puy de d me mountain in central france and found that the column was shorter by three inches this decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand then contract upon descent the original magdeburg hemispheres lower left used to demonstrate otto von guericke s vacuum pump right in 1650 german scientist otto von guericke constructed the first vacuum pump a device that would further refute the principle of horror vacui he correctly noted that the atmosphere of the earth surrounds the planet like a shell with the density gradually declining with altitude he concluded that there must be a vacuum between the earth and the moon back in the 15th century german theologian nicolaus cusanus speculated that the universe lacked a center and a circumference he believed that the universe while not infinite could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained these ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the italian philosopher giordano bruno in the 16th century he extended the copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite universe filled with a substance he called aether which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies english philosopher william gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void this concept of an aether originated with ancient greek philosophers including aristotle who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move the concept of a universe filled with a luminiferous aether remained in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century this form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate in 1887 the michelson morley experiment tried to detect the earth s motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet s motion however the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept the idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned it was replaced by albert einstein s theory of special relativity which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant independent of the observer s motion or frame of reference the first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite universe was the englishman thomas digges in 1576 but the scale of the universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the german astronomer friedrich bessel he showed that the star 61 cygni had a parallax of just 0.31 arcseconds compared to the modern value of 0.287 this corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years in 1917 heber curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were on average 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae suggesting that the former are 100 times further away the distance to the andromeda galaxy was determined in 1923 by american astronomer edwin hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy a new technique discovered by henrietta leavitt this established that the andromeda galaxy and by extension all galaxies lay well outside the milky way the earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the swiss physicist charles guillaume in 1896 using the estimated radiation of the background stars he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5 6 k british physicist arthur eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18 k in 1926 german physicist erich regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8 k in 1933 the modern concept of outer space is based on the big bang cosmology first proposed in 1931 by the belgian physicist georges lema tre this theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous expansion the background energy released during the initial expansion has steadily decreased in density leading to a 1948 prediction by american physicists ralph alpher and robert herman of a temperature of 5 k for the temperature of space the term outward space was used in 1842 by the english poet lady emmeline stuart wortley in her poem the maiden of moscow the expression outer space was used as an astronomical term by alexander von humboldt in 1845 it was later popularized in the writings of h g wells in 1901 the shorter term space is older first used to mean the region beyond earth s sky in john milton s paradise lost in 1667 this is an artist s concept of the metric expansion of space where a volume of the universe is represented at each time interval by the circular sections at left is depicted the rapid inflation from the initial state followed thereafter by steady expansion to the present day shown at right main article big bang according to the big bang theory the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago which rapidly expanded about 380,000 years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen the so called recombination epoch when this happened matter and energy became decoupled allowing photons to travel freely through space matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars galaxies and other astronomical objects leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space as light has a finite velocity this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe this leaves open the question as to whether the universe is finite or infinite the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe these observations indicate that the observable universe is flat meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe except for local gravity the flat universe combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating expansion of the universe indicates that space has a non zero vacuum energy which is called dark energy estimates put the average energy density of the universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter including dark energy dark matter and baryonic matter ordinary matter composed of atoms the atoms account for only 4.6 of the total energy density or a density of one proton per four cubic meters the density of the universe however is clearly not uniform it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies including very high density in structures within galaxies such as planets stars and black holes to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density at least in terms of visible matter unlike matter and dark matter dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass energy in the universe dark energy s influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the milky way part of the hubble ultra deep field image showing a typical section of space containing galaxies interspersed by deep vacuum given the finite speed of light this view covers the last of the history of outer space outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum it has effectively no friction allowing stars planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits however even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter by comparison the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km or 10 billion light years in spite of this extinction which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy stars planets and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space the earth s atmospheric pressure drops to about pa at 100 kilometres 62 miles of altitude compared to 100,000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac definition of standard pressure above this altitude isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure temperature and composition and varies greatly due to space weather the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas as it is on earth however the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium all of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the big bang which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation cmb there is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background the current black body temperature of the background radiation is about 3 k 270 c 454 f the gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the cmb but can be much higher for example the corona of the sun reaches temperatures over 1.2 2.6 million k magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small scale dynamos creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5 10 g the davis greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy s magnetic field resulting in weak optical polarization this has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies magneto hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes non thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant high z sources indicating the presence of magnetic fields outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays these particles have energies ranging from about 106 ev up to an extreme 1020 ev of ultra high energy cosmic rays the peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109 ev with approximately 87 protons 12 helium nuclei and 1 heavier nuclei in the high energy range the flux of electrons is only about 1 of that of protons cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers according to astronauts like don pettit space has a burned metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment similar to the scent of an arc welding torch despite the harsh environment several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods species of lichen carried on the esa biopan facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007 seeds of arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years a strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low earth orbit or a simulated martian environment the lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system with potentially microorganism bearing rocks being exchanged between venus earth and mars see also space exposure and weightlessness because of the hazards of a vacuum astronauts must wear a pressurized space suit while off earth and outside their spacecraft even at relatively low altitudes in the earth s atmosphere conditions are hostile to the human body the altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body is called the armstrong line named after american physician harry g armstrong it is located at an altitude of around 19.14 km 11.89 mi at or above the armstrong line fluids in the throat and lungs boil away more specifically exposed bodily liquids such as saliva tears and liquids in the lungs boil away hence at this altitude human survival requires a pressure suit or a pressurized capsule once in space sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low pressure such as during a rapid decompression can cause pulmonary barotrauma a rupture of the lungs due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest even if the subject s airway is fully open the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia as a consequence of rapid decompression oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3 kpa and this condition is called ebullism the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels so some blood remains liquid swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit the crew altitude protection suit caps a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kpa supplemental oxygen is needed at 8 km 5.0 mi to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss while above 20 km 12 mi pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism most space suits use around 30 39 kpa of pure oxygen about the same as on the earth s surface this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed humans evolved for life in earth gravity and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health initially more than 50 of astronauts experience space motion sickness this can cause nausea and vomiting vertigo headaches lethargy and overall malaise the duration of space sickness varies but it typically lasts for 1 3 days after which the body adjusts to the new environment longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton or spaceflight osteopenia these effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise other effects include fluid redistribution slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass nasal congestion sleep disturbance and puffiness of the face for long duration space travel radiation can pose an acute health hazard exposure to high energy ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue nausea vomiting as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count over longer durations symptoms include an increased risk of cancer plus damage to the eyes nervous system lungs and the gastrointestinal tract on a round trip mars mission lasting three years a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut s body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei fortunately the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers however the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures spaceshipone completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004 reaching an altitude of 100.12 km 62.21 mi there is no clear boundary between earth s atmosphere and space as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases there are several standard boundary designations namely the f d ration a ronautique internationale has established the k rm n line at an altitude of 100 km 62 mi as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics this is used because at an altitude of about 100 km 62 mi as theodore von k rm n calculated a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself the united states designates people who travel above an altitude of 50 miles 80 km as astronauts nasa s space shuttle used 400,000 feet 76 mi 122 km as its re entry altitude termed the entry interface which roughly marks the boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with air surfaces in 2009 scientists reported detailed measurements with a supra thermal ion imager an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions which allowed them to establish a boundary at 118 km 73 mi above earth the boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the earth s atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space which can reach speeds well over 268 m s 600 mph main article space law 2008 launch of the sm-3 missile used to destroy american reconnaissance satellite usa-193 the outer space treaty provides the basic framework for international space law it covers the legal use of outer space by nation states and includes in its definition of outer space the moon and other celestial bodies the treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty it also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space the treaty was passed by the united nations general assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the ussr the united states of america and the united kingdom as of 2008 the treaty has been ratified by 98 states and signed by an additional 27 states since 1958 outer space has been the subject of multiple united nations resolutions of these more than 50 have been concerning the international co operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the un s committee on the peaceful uses of outer space still there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space and anti satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the us ussr and china the 1979 moon treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies including the orbits around such bodies over to the international community however this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight in 1976 eight equatorial states ecuador colombia brazil congo zaire uganda kenya and indonesia met in bogot colombia with their declaration of the first meeting of equatorial countries or the bogot declaration they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country these claims are not internationally accepted a spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity for a low earth orbit this velocity is about 7,800 m s 28,100 km h 17,400 mph by contrast the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft was 2,200 m s 7,900 km h 4,900 mph in 1967 by the north american x-15 to achieve an orbit a spacecraft must travel faster than a sub orbital spaceflight the energy required to reach earth orbital velocity at an altitude of 600 km 370 mi is about 36 mj kg which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude spacecraft with a perigee below about 2,000 km 1,200 mi are subject to drag from the earth s atmosphere which decreases the orbital altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite s cross sectional area and mass as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere below about 300 km 190 mi decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days once a satellite descends to 180 km 110 mi it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere the escape velocity required to pull free of earth s gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about 11,200 m s 40,300 km h 25,100 mph space is a partial vacuum its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and winds that dominate within them and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond geospace extends from earth s atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth s magnetic field whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space interplanetary space extends to the heliopause whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy where it fades into the intergalactic void aurora australis observed from the space shuttle discovery on sts-39 may 1991 orbital altitude 260 km geospace is the region of outer space near earth including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere the van allen radiation belts lies within the geospace the outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause which forms an interface between the earth s magnetosphere and the solar wind the inner boundary is the ionosphere the variable space weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics the study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system the day side magnetopause is compressed by solar wind pressure the subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii on the night side the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100 200 earth radii for roughly four days of each month the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the moon passes through the magnetotail geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities the motions of which are controlled by the earth s magnetic field these plasmas form a medium from which storm like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the earth s upper atmosphere geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace the radiation belts and the ionosphere these storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics interfering with shortwave radio communication and gps location and timing magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts even in low earth orbit they also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles although it meets the definition of outer space the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the k rm n line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites this region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft some of this debris re enters earth s atmosphere periodically proposed spacecraft for manned cislunar travel in 2020s earth s gravity keeps the moon in orbit at an average distance of 384,403 km 238,857 mi the region outside earth s atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the moon s orbit including the lagrangian points is sometimes referred to as cis lunar space the region of space where the gravity of the earth remains dominant against gravitational perturbations from the sun is called the hill sphere this extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1 of the mean distance from the earth to the sun or 1.5 million km 0.93 million mi deep space has different definitions as to where it starts it has been defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space the international telecommunication union responsible for radio communication including satellites defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance main article interplanetary medium the sparse plasma blue and dust white in the tail of comet hale bopp are being shaped by pressure from solar radiation and the solar wind respectively interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere the heliosphere for billions of kilometers into space this wind has a particle density of 5 10 protons cm3 and is moving at a velocity of 350 400 km s 780,000 890,000 mph interplanetary space extends out to the heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the sun the distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth however this space is not completely empty and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles there is also gas plasma and dust small meteors and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy a cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the sun there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter saturn mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields these are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape with the long tail extending outward behind the planet these magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources creating belts of charged particles such as the van allen radiation belts planets without magnetic fields such as mars have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind main article interstellar medium interstellar space redirects here for the album see interstellar space bow shock formed by the magnetosphere of the young star ll orionis center as it collides with the orion nebula flow interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma the contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium approximately 70 of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms most of the remainder consists of helium atoms this is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis these atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula the cataclysmic explosion of a supernova generates an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably the average is around 106 particles per m3 but cold molecular clouds can hold 108 1012 per m3 a number of molecules exist in interstellar space as can tiny 0.1 m dust particles the tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur including the formation of organic polyatomic species much of this chemistry is driven by collisions energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium resulting for example in the trihydrogen cation an ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions the local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 parsecs pc of the sun which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the solar system this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble which is characterized by a lack of dense cold clouds it forms a cavity in the orion arm of the milky way galaxy with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders such as those in the constellations of ophiuchus and taurus the actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250 pc or more this volume contains about 104 105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium the local bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000 k and radii of 0.5 5 pc when stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium for decades it was assumed that the sun had a bow shock in 2012 data from interstellar boundary explorer ibex and nasa s voyager probes showed that the sun s bow shock does not exist instead these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium a bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause called the heliopause in the solar system a star forming region in the large magellanic cloud perhaps the closest galaxy to earth s milky way see also intracluster medium intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the universe has a foam like structure with clusters and groups of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space the remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies typically a void spans a distance of 10 40 h 1 mpc where h is the hubble constant in units of surrounding and stretching between galaxies there is a rarefied plasma that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure this material is called the intergalactic medium igm the density of the igm is 5 200 times the average density of the universe it consists mostly of ionized hydrogen i e a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons as gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids it heats up to temperatures of 105 k to 107 k which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei this is why the igm is ionized at these temperatures it is called the warm hot intergalactic medium whim although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards 105 k is often called warm in astrophysics computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the universe might exist in this warm hot rarefied state when gas falls from the filamentary structures of the whim into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments it can heat up even more reaching temperatures of 108 k and above in the so called intracluster medium main articles space exploration space colonization and space manufacturing the first image taken of the entire earth by astronauts was shot during the apollo 8 mission for the majority of human history space was explored by observations made from the earth s surface initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights in 1935 the u s explorer ii manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of 22 km 14 mi this was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the german a-4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about 80 km 50 mi in 1957 the unmanned satellite sputnik 1 was launched by a russian r-7 rocket achieving earth orbit at an altitude of 215 939 kilometres 134 583 mi this was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961 when yuri gagarin was sent into orbit on vostok 1 the first humans to escape earth orbit were frank borman jim lovell and william anders in 1968 on board the u s apollo 8 which achieved lunar orbit and reached a maximum distance of 377,349 km 234,474 mi from the earth the first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the soviet luna 1 which performed a fly by of the moon in 1959 in 1961 venera 1 became the first planetary probe it revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly by of venus although contact was lost before reaching venus the first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly by of venus by mariner 2 the first fly by of mars was by mariner 4 in 1964 since that time unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the solar system s planets as well their moons and many minor planets and comets they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space as well as observation of the earth in august 2012 voyager 1 became the first man made object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space the absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum this is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the hubble space telescope allowing light from more than 13 billion years ago almost to the time of the big bang to be observed however not every location in space is ideal for a telescope the interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness likewise a site like the daedalus crater on the far side of the moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers earth based observations unmanned spacecraft in earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization they allow direct monitoring of weather conditions relay long range communications like television provide a means of precise navigation and allow remote sensing of the earth the latter role serves a wide variety of purposes including tracking soil moisture for agriculture prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs detection of diseases in plants and trees and surveillance of military activities the deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces however like asteroid mining space manufacturing requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return an important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into earth orbit 7,000 24,000 per kg in inflation adjusted dollars according to a 2006 estimate proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non rocket spacelaunch momentum exchange tethers and space elevators interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility the distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades for example the daedalus project study which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of deuterium and he3 would require 36 years to reach the nearby alpha centauri system other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails ramjets and beam powered propulsion more advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel potentially reaching relativistic velocities earth s location in the universe list of government space agencies list of topics in space outline of space science
