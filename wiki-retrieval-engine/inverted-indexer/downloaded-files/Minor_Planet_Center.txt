from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the minor planet center mpc is the official worldwide organization in charge of collecting observational data for minor planets such as asteroids and comets calculating their orbits and publishing this information via the minor planet circulars under the auspices of the international astronomical union iau it operates at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory which is part of the center for astrophysics along with the harvard college observatory the mpc runs a number of free online services for observers to assist them in observing minor planets and comets the complete catalogue of minor planet orbits sometimes referred to as the minor planet catalogue may also be freely downloaded in addition to astrometric data the mpc collects light curve photometry of minor planets a key function of the mpc is helping observers coordinate follow up observations of possible near earth objects neos via its neo web form and blog the mpc is also responsible for identifying and alerting to new neos with a risk of impacting earth in the few weeks following their discovery see potentially hazardous objects and videos contents the minor planet center was set up at the university of cincinnati in 1947 under the direction of paul herget upon herget s retirement on june 30 1978 the mpc was moved to the sao under the direction of brian g marsden from 2006 2015 the director of the mpc was timothy spahr who oversaw a staff of five as of february 2015 update the minor planet center is headed by interim director matthew holman minor planet circulars and minor planet electronic circulars redirect here for the publication by alpo see the minor planet bulletin the mpc periodically releases astrometric observations of minor planets as well as of comets and natural satellites these publications are the minor planet circulars mpcs the minor planet electronic circulars mpecs and the minor planet supplements mpss and mpos an extensive archive of publications in a pdf format is available at the minor planet center s website the archive s oldest publication dates back to 1 november 1977 mpc 4937 5016 minor planet circulars m p c or mpcs established 1947 is a scientific journal that is generally published by the minor planet center on the date of each full moon when the number of reported observations are minimal due to the brighter night sky the circulars contain astrometric observations orbits and ephemerides of minor planets comets and certain natural satellites the astrometric observations of comets are published in full while the minor planet observations are summarised by observatory code the full observations now being given in the minor planet circulars supplement new numberings and namings of minor planets also see naming of minor planets as well as numberings of periodic comets and natural satellites are announced in the circulars new orbits for comets and natural satellites appear in the circulars new orbits for minor planets appear in the minor planets and comets orbit supplement see below the minor planet electronic circulars mpecs are published by the minor planet center they generally contain positional observations and orbits of unusual minor planets and all comets monthly lists of observable unusual objects observable distant objects observable comets and the critical list of numbered minor planets also appear on these circulars daily orbit update mpecs issued every day contain new identifications and orbits of minor planets obtained over the previous 24 hours the minor planets and comets supplement mps is published on behalf of iau s division f planetary systems and bioastronomy by the minor planet center the minor planets and comets orbit supplement mpo is published on behalf of iau s division f by the minor planet center central bureau for astronomical telegrams international astronomical union circular list of minor planet groups list of minor planets main index meanings of minor planet names minor planet center homepage minor planet center publication archive all published circulars since 1977 downloadable as pdf mpcorb the mpc orbit mpcorb database downloadable catalog files the minor planet center status report matthew j holman 8 november 2015 recent mpecs list of most recently published minor planet electronic circulars on youtube on youtube on youtube authority control retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title minor planet center oldid 820317520 categories astronomy data and publicationsastronomy magazinesastronomy organizationsamerican science and technology magazinesmagazines established in 1947hidden categories articles containing potentially dated statements from february 2015all articles containing potentially dated statementswikipedia articles with viaf identifierswikipedia articles with lccn identifierswikipedia articles with gnd identifiers
