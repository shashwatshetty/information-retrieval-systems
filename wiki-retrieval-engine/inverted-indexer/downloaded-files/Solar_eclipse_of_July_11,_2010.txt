touching several atolls in french polynesia the cook islands easter island and argentina s patagonian plains fred espenak a nasa astrophysicist said one of the most unique things about this particular eclipse is that it crosses a unique and interesting archaeological site easter island on easter island there are these great statues there s a lot of mystery about these statues but in any case this is the first total eclipse to hit the island in about 1,400 years in french polynesia the eclipse was seen with 98 percent totality during that time the diamond ring effect and the baily s beads occurred it ended at sunset over the southern tips of argentina and chile in south america including the town of el calafate the sun s altitude was only 1 during the 2 minute 47 second total phase but argentino lake offered an adequate line of sight to the eclipse hanging just above the rugged andes skyline a 58 partiality occurred at sunset in santiago chile but it was not visible due to adverse weather conditions in other cities such as valpara so and coquimbo clearer skies permitted the event to be witnessed in continental chile time lapse images of the eclipse as seen from vi a del mar

the 2010 fifa world cup was being played in south africa and many soccer fans in tahiti watched the match instead of observing the partial eclipse with a high percentage of obscuring the sun by about 98 percent the path of totality of this eclipse barely missed some significant inhabited islands including passing just about 20 km north of the northern end of tahiti this eclipse was the first one to happen over french polynesia in 350 years an estimated 5,000 tourists visited various islands in the archipelago to observe the event nearly 120,000 pairs of special glasses were distributed for
