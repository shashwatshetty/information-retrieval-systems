areas known as the indo european urheimat samara culture sredny stog culture yamna culture the territory of kalmykia is unique in that it has been the home in successive periods to many major world religions and ideologies prehistoric paganism and shamanism gave way to judaism with the khazars this was succeeded by islam with the alans while the mongol hordes brought tengriism and the later nogais were muslim before their replacement by the present day buddhist oirats kalmyks with the annexation of the territory by the russian empire christianity arrived with slavic settlers before all

volga region various reasons have been given for the move but the generally accepted answer is that the kalmyks sought abundant pastures for their herds another motivation may have been to escape the growing dominance of the neighboring dzungar mongol tribe they reached the lower volga region in or about 1630 that land however was not uncontested pastures but rather the homeland of the nogai horde a confederation of turkic speaking nomadic tribes the kalmyks expelled the nogais who fled to the caucasian plains and to the crimean khanate areas under the control of the ottoman empire some nogai groups sought the protection of the russian garrison at astrakhan the remaining nomadic mongol oirats tribes became vassals of kalmyk khan the kalmyks settled in the wide open steppes from saratov in the north to astrakhan on the volga delta in the south and to the terek river in the southwest they also encamped on both sides of the volga river from the don river in the west to the ural river in the east although these territories had been recently annexed by russia it was in no position to settle the area with russian colonists this area under kalmyk control would eventually be called the kalmyk khanate within twenty five years of settling in the lower volga region the kalmyks became subjects of the tsar in exchange for protecting russia s southern border the kalmyks were promised an annual allowance and access to the markets of russian border settlements the open access to russian markets was supposed to discourage mutual raiding on the part of the kalmyks and of the russians and bashkirs a russian dominated turkic people but this was not often the practice in addition kalmyk allegiance was often nominal as the kalmyk khans practiced self government based on a set of laws they called the great code of the nomads iki tsaadzhin bichig the kalmyk khanate reached its peak of military and political power under ayuka khan 1669 1724 during his era the kalmyk khanate fulfilled its responsibility to protect the southern borders of russia and conducted many military expeditions against its turkic speaking neighbors successful military expeditions were also conducted in the caucasus the khanate experienced economic prosperity from free trade with russian border towns china tibet and with their muslim neighbors during this era the kalmyks also kept close contacts with

1919 bolshevik leader vladimir lenin issued an appeal to the kalmyk people calling for them to revolt and to aid the red army lenin promised to provide the kalmyks among other things a sufficient quantity of land for their own use the promise came to fruition on november 4 1920 when a resolution was passed by the all russian central executive committee proclaiming the formation of the kalmyk autonomous oblast fifteen years later on october 22 1935 the oblast was elevated to republic status kalmyk autonomous soviet socialist republic in line with the policy of korenizatsiya based on the concept of titular nations the government of the soviet union adopted a strategy of national delimitation while at the same time enforcing the leninist principle of democratic centralism according to dorzha arbakov decentralized governing bodies were a tool the bolsheviks used to control the kalmyk people the soviet authorities were greatly interested in sovietizing kalmykia as quickly as possible and with the least amount of bloodshed although the kalmyks alone were not a significant force the soviet authorities wished to win popularity in the asian and buddhist worlds by demonstrating their evident concern for the buddhists in russia after establishing control the soviet authorities did not overtly enforce an anti religion policy other than through passive means because it sought to bring mongolia and tibet into its sphere of influence the government also was compelled to respond to domestic disturbances resulting from the economic policies of war communism and the 1921 famine the passive measures that were taken by soviet authorities to control the people included the imposition of a harsh tax to close places of worship and religious schools the cyrillic script replaced
