9 2016 transit of mercury on november 8 2006 with sunspots 921 922 and 923 mercury transiting the sun as viewed by the rover curiosity on mars june 3 2014 a transit of mercury across the sun takes place when the planet mercury passes directly between the sun and a superior planet becoming visible against and hence obscuring a small portion of the solar disk during a transit mercury appears as a tiny black dot moving across the disk of the sun transits of mercury with respect to earth are much more frequent than transits of venus with about 13 or 14 per century in part because mercury is closer to the sun and orbits it more rapidly transits of mercury occur in may or november the last four transits occurred on november 15 1999 may 7 2003 november 8 2006 and may 9 2016 the next will occur on november 11 2019 and then on november 13 2032 a typical transit lasts several hours on june 3 2014 the mars rover curiosity observed the planet mercury transiting the sun marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides earth more generally transits can also occur for venus and were investigated in the context of searching for the hypothetical inner planet vulcan contents the most common observation to be made at a transit is to record the times when the disk of mercury appears to be in contact with the limb of the sun those contacts are traditionally referred to as the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th contacts with the 2nd and 3rd contacts occurring when the disk of mercury is fully on the disk of the sun as a general rule 1st and 4th contacts cannot be accurately detected while 2nd and 3rd contacts are readily visible within the constraints of the black drop effect irradiation atmospheric conditions and the quality of the optics being used observed contact times for transits between 1677 and 1881 are given in s newcomb s analysis of transits of mercury observed 2nd and 3rd contacts times for transits between 1677 and 1973 are given in royal greenwich observatory bulletin no.181 359-420 1975 examples of the scientific investigations based on transits of mercury are investigations of the variability of the earth s rotation and of the tidal acceleration of the moon measuring the mass of venus from secular variations in mercury s orbit looking for long term variations in the solar radius investigating the black drop effect including calling into question the purported discovery of the atmosphere of venus during the 1761 transit assessing the likely drop in light level in an exoplanet transit images of the november 15 1999 transit from the transition region and coronal explorer trace satellite were on astronomy picture of the day apod on november 19 three apod s featured the may 9 2016 transit transits of mercury can only occur when the earth is aligned with a node of mercury s orbit currently that alignment occurs within a few days of may 8 descending node and november 10 ascending node with the angular diameter of mercury being about 12 for may transits and 10 for november transits the average date for a transit increases over centuries as a result of the longitude of the nodes of mercury s orbit increasing by about 1.1 deg per century transits of mercury occur on a regular basis as explained in 1882 by newcomb the interval between passages of mercury through the ascending node of its orbit is 87.969 days and the interval between the earth s passage through that same longitude is 365.254 days from the ratio of these values it can be easily shown that mercury will make an almost integral number of revolutions about the sun over intervals of 4 6 7 13 33 46 171 and 217 years in 1894 crommelin noted that at these intervals the successive paths of mercury relative to the sun are consistently displaced northwards or southwards he noted the displacements as displacements at subsequent transits interval may transits november transits after 6 years 65 37 s 31 35 n after 7 years 48 21 n 23 16 s hence after 13 years 6 7 17 16 s 8 19 n 20 years 1x6 2x7 31 05 n 14 57 s 33 years 2x6 3x7 13 49 n 6 38 s 46 years 3x13 7 3 27 s 1 41 n 217 years 14x13 5x7 0 17 n nowadays see talk 0 14 n nowadays see talk comparing these displacements with the solar diameter about 31.7 for may and 32.4 for november transits the following may be deduced about the interval between transits for may transits intervals of 6 and 7 years are not possible for november transits an interval of 6 years is possible but rare the last such pair was 1993 and 1999 while an interval of 7 years is to be expected an interval of 13 years is to be expected for both may and november transits an interval of 20 years is possible but rare for a may transit but is to be expected for november transits an interval of 33 years is to be expected for both may and november transits a transit having a similar path across the sun will occur 46 171 years later for both november and may transits a transit having an almost identical path across the sun will occur 217 years later for both november and may transits transits that occur 46 years apart can be grouped into a series for november transits each series includes about 20 transits over 874 years with the path of mercury across the sun passing further north than for the previous transit for may transits each series includes about 10 transits over 414 years with the path of mercury across the sun passing further south than for the previous transit some authors have allocated a series number to transits on the basis of this 46 year grouping similarly transits that occur 217 years apart can be grouped into a series for november transits each series would include about 135 transits over 30,000 years for may transits each series would include about 110 transits over 24,000 years for both the may and november series the path of mercury across the sun passes further north than for the previous transit series numbers have not been traditionally allocated on the basis of the 217 year grouping predictions of transits of mercury covering many years are available at nasa solex and fourmilab november 15 1999 simulated transit of mercury across the sun sometimes mercury appears to only graze the sun during a transit there are two possible scenarios firstly it is possible for a transit to occur where at mid transit the disk of mercury has fully entered the disk of the sun as seen from some parts of the world while as seen from other parts of the world the disk of mercury has only partially entered the disk of the sun the transit of november 15 1999 was such a transit with the transit being a full transit for most of the world but only a partial transit for australia new zealand and antarctica the previous such transit was on october 28 743 and the next will be on may 11 2391 while these events are very rare two such transits will occur within 2 years on december 6149 and june 6152 secondly it is possible for a transit to occur where at mid transit the disk of mercury has partially entered the disk of the sun as seen from some parts of the world while as seen from other parts of the world mercury completely misses the sun such a transit last occurred on may 11 1937 where a partial transit occurred in southern africa and southern asia and no transit was visible from europe and northern asia the previous such transit was on october 21 1342 and the next will be on may 13 2608 the possibility where at mid transit mercury is seen to be fully on the solar disk from some parts of the world and completely miss the sun as seen from other parts of the world cannot occur the first observation of a transit of mercury was on november 7 1631 by pierre gassendi johannes kepler had however predicted the occurrence of transits of mercury and venus some time before that gassendi unsuccessfully attempted to observe the transit of venus just one month later but due to inaccurate astronomical tables he did not realize that it was not visible from most of europe a transit of venus was not observed until 1639 by jeremiah horrocks the table below includes all historical transits of mercury from 1605 on past transits of mercury date of mid
