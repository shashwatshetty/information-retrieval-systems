from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in astronomy stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with spectral lines each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element the strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere although in some cases there are true abundance differences the spectral class of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the ionization state giving an objective measure of the photosphere s temperature most stars are currently classified under the morgan keenan mk system using the letters o b a f g k and m a sequence from the hottest o type to the coolest m type each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest e g a8 a9 f0 and f1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler the sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star like objects that do not fit in the classical system such as class d for white dwarfs and classes s and c for carbon stars in the mk system a luminosity class is added to the spectral class using roman numerals this is based on the width of certain absorption lines in the star s spectrum which vary with the density of the atmosphere and so distinguish giant stars from dwarfs luminosity class 0 or ia is used for hypergiants class i for supergiants class ii for bright giants class iii for regular giants class iv for sub giants class v for main sequence stars class sd or vi for sub dwarfs and class d or vii for white dwarfs the full spectral class for the sun is then g2v indicating a main sequence star with a temperature around 5,800 k contents main article green star astronomy just saturated rgb camera discs the conventional color description takes into account only the peak of the stellar spectrum however in actuality stars radiate in all parts of the spectrum and because all spectral colors combined appear white the actual apparent colors the human eye would observe are far lighter than the conventional color descriptions would suggest this means that the simplified assignment of colors of the spectrum can be misleading excluding color contrast illusions in dim light there are no green indigo or violet stars red dwarfs are a deep shade of orange and brown dwarfs do not literally appear brown but hypothetically would appear to be a dim grey to a nearby observer the morgan keenan spectral classification the modern classification system is known as the morgan keenan mk classification each star is assigned a spectral class from the older harvard spectral classification and a luminosity class using roman numerals as explained below forming the star s spectral type other modern stellar classification systems such as the ubv system are based on color indexes the measured differences in three or more color magnitudes those numbers are given labels such as u v or b v which represent the colors passed by two standard filters e g ultraviolet blue and visual the harvard system is a one dimensional classification scheme by astronomer annie jump cannon who re ordered and simplified a prior alphabetical system stars are grouped according to their spectral characteristics by single letters of the alphabet optionally with numeric subdivisions main sequence stars vary in surface temperature from approximately 2,000 to 50,000 k whereas more evolved stars can have temperatures above 100,000 k physically the classes indicate the temperature of the star s atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest class effective temperature vega relative chromaticity chromaticity d65 main sequence mass solar masses main sequence radius solar radii main sequence

specialized classes discussed later are subdivided by arabic numerals 0 9 where 0 denotes the hottest stars of a given class for example a0 denotes the hottest stars in class a and a9 denotes the coolest ones fractional numbers are allowed for example the star mu normae is classified as o9.7 the sun is classified as g2 conventional color descriptions are traditional in astronomy and represent colors relative to the mean color of an a class star which is considered to be white the apparent color descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye or with binoculars however most stars in the sky except the brightest ones appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body the fact that the harvard classification of a star indicated its surface or photospheric temperature or more precisely its effective temperature was not fully understood until after its development though by the time the first hertzsprung russell diagram was formulated by 1914 this was generally suspected to be true in the 1920s the bengali physicist meghnad saha derived a theory of ionization by extending well known ideas in physical chemistry pertaining to the dissociation of molecules to the ionization of atoms first he applied it to the solar chromosphere then to stellar spectra the harvard astronomer cecilia helena payne later to become cecilia payne gaposchkin then demonstrated that the o b a f g k m spectral sequence is actually a sequence in temperature because the classification sequence predates our understanding that it is a temperature sequence the placement of a spectrum into a given subtype such as b3 or a7 depends upon largely subjective estimates of the strengths of absorption features in stellar spectra as a result these subtypes are not evenly divided into any sort of mathematically representable intervals spectra for dwarfs luminosity class v for standard spectral types taken from pickles 1998 several notable spectral lines are indicated hydrogen lines are strongest for types a and b and the overall spectrum peaks at shorter wavelengths for hotter stars the yerkes spectral classification also called the mkk system from the authors initials is a system of stellar spectral classification introduced in 1943 by william wilson morgan philip c keenan and edith kellman from yerkes observatory this two dimensional temperature and luminosity classification scheme is based on spectral lines sensitive to stellar temperature and surface gravity which is related to luminosity whilst the harvard classification is based on just surface temperature later in 1953 after some revisions of list of standard stars and classification criteria the scheme was named the morgan keenan classification or mk by william wilson morgan and philip c keenan s initials and this system remains the system in modern use today denser stars with higher surface gravity exhibit greater pressure broadening of spectral lines the gravity and hence the pressure on the surface of a giant star is much lower than for a dwarf star because the radius of the giant is much greater than a dwarf of similar mass therefore differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as luminosity effects and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum a number of different luminosity classes are distinguished as listed in the table below yerkes luminosity classes luminosity class description examples 0 or ia hypergiants or extremely luminous supergiants cygnus ob2 12

maanen 2 dz8 marginal cases are allowed for example a star may be either a supergiant or a bright giant or may be in between the subgiant and main sequence classifications in these cases two special symbols are used a slash means that a star is either one class or the other a dash means that the star is in between the two classes for example a star classified as a3-4iii iv would be in between spectral types a3 and a4 while being either a giant star or a subgiant sub dwarf classes have also been used vi for sub dwarfs stars slightly less luminous than the main sequence nominal luminosity class vii and sometimes higher numerals is now rarely used for white dwarf or hot sub dwarf classes since the temperature letters of the main sequence and giant stars no longer apply to white dwarfs

spectral types 152 schjellerup is y canum venaticorum the reason for the odd arrangement of letters in the harvard classification is historical having evolved from the earlier secchi classes and been progressively modified as understanding improved during the 1860s and 1870s pioneering stellar spectroscopist angelo secchi created the secchi classes in order to classify observed spectra by 1866 he had developed three classes of stellar spectra shown in the table below in the late 1890s this classification began to be superseded by the harvard classification which is discussed in the remainder of this article class number secchi class description secchi class i white and blue stars with broad heavy hydrogen lines such as vega and altair this includes the modern class a and early class f secchi class i orion subtype a subtype of secchi class i with narrow lines in place of wide bands such as rigel and bellatrix in modern terms this corresponds to early b type stars secchi class ii yellow stars hydrogen less strong but evident metallic lines such as the sun arcturus and capella this includes the modern classes g and k as well as late class f secchi class iii orange to red stars with complex band spectra such as betelgeuse and antares this corresponds to the modern class m secchi class iv in 1868 he discovered carbon stars which he put into a distinct group red stars with significant carbon bands and lines corresponding to modern classes c and s secchi class v in 1877 he added a fifth class emission line stars such as gamma cassiopeiae and sheliak which are in modern class be the roman numerals used for secchi classes should not be confused with the completely unrelated roman numerals used for yerkes luminosity classes classifications in the draper catalogue of stellar spectra secchi draper comment i a b c d hydrogen lines dominant ii e f g h i k l iii m iv n did not appear in the catalogue o wolf rayet spectra with bright lines p planetary nebulae q other spectra classes carried through into the mk system are in bold in the 1880s the astronomer edward c pickering began to make a survey of stellar spectra at the harvard college observatory using the objective prism method a first result of this work was the draper catalogue of stellar spectra published in 1890 williamina fleming classified most of the spectra in this catalogue the catalogue used a scheme in which the previously used secchi classes i to iv were subdivided into more specific classes given letters from a to n also the letters o p and q were used o for stars whose spectra consisted mainly of bright lines p for planetary nebulae and q for stars not fitting into any other class in 1897 another worker at harvard antonia maury placed the orion subtype of secchi class i ahead of the remainder of secchi class i thus placing the modern type b ahead of the modern type a she was the first to do so although she did not use lettered spectral types but rather a series of twenty two types numbered from i to xxii in 1901 annie jump cannon returned to the lettered types but dropped all letters except o b a f g k and m used in that order as well as p for planetary nebulae and q for some peculiar spectra she also used types such as b5a for stars halfway between types b and a f2g for stars one fifth of the way from f to g and so on finally by 1912 cannon had changed the types b a b5a f2g etc to b0 a0 b5 f2 etc this is essentially the modern form of the harvard classification system a common mnemonic for remembering the order of the spectral type letters from hottest to coolest is oh be a fine guy girl kiss me a luminosity classification known as the mount wilson system was used to distinguish between stars of different luminosities this notation system is still sometimes seen on modern spectra class meaning sd subdwarf d dwarf sg subgiant g giant c supergiant the stellar classification system is taxonomic based on type specimens similar to classification of species in biology the categories are defined by one or more standard stars for each category and sub category with an associated description of the distinguishing features look up late type star or early type star in wiktionary the free dictionary stars are often referred to as early or late types early is a synonym for hotter while late is a synonym for cooler depending on the context early and late may be absolute or relative terms early as an absolute term would therefore refer to o or b and possibly a stars as a relative reference it relates to stars hotter than others such as early k being perhaps k0 k1 and k3 late is used in the same way with an unqualified use of the term indicating stars with spectral types such as k and m but it can also be used for stars that are cool relative to other stars as in using late g to refer to g7 g8 and g9 in the relative sense early means a lower arabic numeral following the class letter and late means a higher number this obscure terminology is a hold over from an early 20th century model of stellar evolution which supposed that stars were powered by gravitational contraction via the kelvin helmholtz mechanism which is now known to not apply to main sequence stars if that were true then stars would start their lives as very hot early type stars and then gradually cool down into late type stars this mechanism provided ages of the sun that were much smaller than what is observed in the geologic record and was rendered obsolete by the discovery that stars are powered by nuclear fusion the terms early and late were carried over beyond the demise of the model they were based on main article o type star see also o type main sequence star blue giant and blue supergiant artist s rendering of zeta puppis an o4 supergiant o type stars are very hot and extremely luminous with most of their radiated output in the ultraviolet range these are the rarest of all main sequence stars about 1 in 3,000,000 0.00003 of the main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are o type stars some of the most massive stars lie within this spectral class o type stars frequently have complicated surroundings that make measurement of their spectra difficult o type spectra formerly were defined by the ratio of the strength of the he ii 4541 relative to that of he i 4471 where is the wavelength measured in ngstr ms spectral type o7 was defined to be the point at which the two intensities are equal with the he i line weakening towards earlier types type o3 was by definition the point at which said line disappears altogether although it can be seen very faintly with modern technology due to this the modern definition uses the ratio of the nitrogen line n iv 4058 to n iii 4634-40-42 o type stars have dominant lines of absorption and sometimes emission for he ii lines prominent ionized si iv o iii n iii and c iii and neutral helium lines strengthening from o5 to o9 and prominent hydrogen balmer lines although not as strong as in later types because they are so massive o type stars have very hot cores and burn through their hydrogen fuel very quickly so they are the first stars to leave the main sequence when the mkk classification scheme was first described in 1943 the only subtypes of class o used were o5 to o9.5 the mkk scheme was extended to o9.7 in 1971 and o4 in 1978 and new classification schemes that add types o2 o3 and o3.5 have subsequently been introduced spectral standards o7v s monocerotis o9v 10 lacertae see also b type main sequence star blue giant and blue supergiant artist s impression of aludra a b5 supergiant seen in canis major b type stars are very luminous and blue their spectra have neutral helium which are most prominent at the b2 subclass and moderate hydrogen lines as o and b type stars are so energetic they only live for a relatively short time thus due to the low probability of kinematic interaction during their lifetime they are unable to stray far from the area in which they formed apart from runaway stars the transition from class o to class b was originally defined to be the point at which the he ii 4541 disappears however with modern equipment the line is still apparent in the early b type stars today for main sequence stars the b class is instead defined by the intensity of the he i violet spectrum with the maximum intensity corresponding to class b2 for supergiants lines of silicon are used instead the si iv 4089 and si iii 4552 lines are indicative of early b at mid b the intensity of the latter relative to that of si ii 4128-30 is the defining characteristic while for late b it is the intensity of mg ii 4481 relative to that of he i 4471 these stars tend to be found in their originating ob associations which are associated with giant molecular clouds the orion ob1 association occupies a large portion of a spiral arm of the milky way and contains many of the brighter stars of the constellation orion

or had at some time one or more balmer lines in emission with the hydrogen related electromagnetic radiation series projected out by the stars being of particular interest be stars are generally thought to feature unusually strong stellar winds high surface temperatures and significant attrition of stellar mass as the objects rotate at a curiously rapid rate objects known as b e or b e stars

the original slash stars main articles brown dwarf and red dwarf the new spectral types l t and y were created to classify infrared spectra of cool stars this includes both red dwarfs and brown dwarfs that are very faint in the visible spectrum brown dwarfs whose energy comes from gravitational attraction alone cool as they age and so progress to later spectral types brown dwarfs start their lives with m type spectra and will cool through the l t and y spectral classes faster the less massive they are the highest mass brown dwarfs cannot have cooled to y or even t dwarfs within the age of the universe because this leads to an unresolvable overlap between spectral types effective temperature and luminosity for some masses and ages of different l t y types no distinct temperature or luminosity values can be given artist s impression of an l dwarf class l dwarfs get their designation because they are cooler than m stars and l is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to m some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs they are a very dark red in color and brightest in infrared their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra due to low surface gravity in giant stars tio and vo bearing condensates never form thus l type stars larger than dwarfs can never form in an isolated environment it may be possible for these l type supergiants to form through stellar collisions however an example of which is v838 monocerotis while in the height of its luminous red nova eruption artist s impression of a t dwarf class t dwarfs are cool brown dwarfs with surface temperatures between approximately 550 and 1,300 k 277 and 1,027 c 530 and 1,880 f their emission peaks in the infrared methane is prominent in their spectra classes t and l could be more common than all the other classes combined if recent research is accurate because brown dwarfs persist for so long a few times the age of the universe in the absence of catastrophic collisions these smaller bodies can only increase in number study of the number of proplyds protoplanetary disks clumps of gas in nebulae from which stars and planetary systems are formed indicates that the number of stars in the galaxy should be several orders of magnitude higher than what was previously conjectured it is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other the first one to form will become a protostar which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity stripping them of their gas the victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the l and t classes which are quite invisible to us see also sub brown dwarf and substellar object artist s impression of a y dwarf brown dwarfs of spectral class y are cooler than those of spectral class t and have qualitatively different spectra from them a total of 17 objects have been placed in class y as of august 2013 although such dwarfs have been modelled and detected within forty light years by the wide field infrared survey explorer wise there is no well defined spectral sequence yet and no prototypes nevertheless several objects have been proposed as spectral classes y0 y1 and y2 the spectra of these prospective y objects display absorption around 1.55 micrometers delorme et al have suggested that this feature is due to absorption from ammonia and that this should be taken as the indicative feature for the t y transition in fact this ammonia absorption feature is the main criterion that has been adopted to define this class however this feature is difficult to distinguish from absorption by water and methane and other authors have stated that the assignment of class y0 is premature the latest brown dwarf proposed for the y spectral type wise 1828 2650 is a y2 dwarf with an effective temperature originally estimated around 300 k the temperature of the human body parallax measurements have however since shown that its luminosity is inconsistent with it being colder than 400 k the coolest y dwarf currently known is wise 0855 0714 with an approximate temperature of 250 k the mass range for y dwarfs is 9 25 jupiter masses but young objects might reach below one jupiter mass which means that y class objects straddle the 13 jupiter mass deuterium fusion limit that marks the current iau division between brown dwarfs and planets carbon stars are stars whose spectra indicate production of carbon a byproduct of triple alpha helium fusion with increased carbon abundance and some parallel s process heavy element production the spectra of these stars become increasingly deviant from the usual late spectral classes g k and m equivalent classes for carbon rich stars are s and c the giants among those stars are presumed to produce this carbon themselves but some stars in this class are double stars whose odd atmosphere is suspected of having been transferred from a companion that is now a white dwarf when the companion was a carbon star main article carbon star image of the carbon star r sculptoris and its striking spiral structure originally classified as r and n stars these are also known as carbon stars these are red giants near the end of their lives in which there is an excess of carbon in the atmosphere the old r and n classes ran parallel to the normal classification system from roughly mid g to late m these have more recently been remapped into a unified carbon classifier c with n0 starting at roughly c6 another subset of cool carbon stars are the c j type stars which are characterized by the strong presence of molecules of 13cn in addition to those of 12cn a few main sequence carbon stars are known but the overwhelming majority of known carbon stars are giants or supergiants there are several subclasses c r formerly its own class r representing the carbon star equivalent of late g to early k type stars c n formerly its own class representing the carbon star equivalent of late k to m type stars c j a subtype of cool c

class s stars form a continuum between class m stars and carbon stars those most similar to class m stars have strong zro absorption bands analogous to the tio bands of class m stars whereas those most similar to carbon stars have strong sodium d lines and weak c2 bands class s stars have excess amounts of zirconium and other elements produced by the s process and have more similar carbon and oxygen abundances than class m or carbon stars like carbon stars nearly all known class s stars are asymptotic giant branch stars the spectral type is formed by the letter s and a number between zero and ten this number corresponds to the temperature of the star and approximately follows the temperature scale used for class m giants the most common types are s3 to s5 the non standard designation s10 has only been used for the star chi cygni when at an extreme minimum the basic classification is usually followed by an abundance indication following one of several schemes s2,5 s2 5 s2 zr4 ti2 or s2 5 a number following a comma is a scale between 1 and 9 based on the ratio of zro and tio a number following a slash is a more recent but less common scheme designed to represent the ratio of carbon to oxygen on a scale of 1 to 10 where a 0 would be an ms star intensities of zirconium and titanium may be indicated explicitly also occasionally seen is a number following an asterisk which represents the strength of the zro bands on a scale from 1 to 5 in between the m and s classes border cases are named ms stars in a similar way border cases between the s and c n classes are named sc

shrunk to planetary size slowly cooling down class d is further divided into spectral types da db dc do dq dx and dz the letters are not related to the letters used in the classification of other stars but instead indicate the composition of the white dwarf s visible outer layer or atmosphere the white dwarf types are as follows da a hydrogen rich atmosphere or outer layer indicated by strong balmer hydrogen spectral lines db a helium rich atmosphere indicated by neutral helium he i spectral lines do a helium rich atmosphere indicated by ionized helium he ii spectral lines dq a carbon rich atmosphere indicated by atomic or molecular carbon lines dz a metal rich atmosphere indicated by metal spectral lines a merger of the obsolete white dwarf spectral types dg dk and dm dc no strong spectral lines indicating one of the above categories dx spectral lines are insufficiently clear to classify into one of the above categories the type is followed by a number giving the white dwarf s surface temperature this number is a rounded form of 50400 teff where teff is the effective surface temperature measured in kelvins originally this number was rounded to one of the digits 1 through 9 but more recently fractional values have started to be used as well as values below 1 and above 9 two or more of the type letters may be used to indicate a white dwarf that displays more than one of the spectral features above extended white dwarf spectral types dab a hydrogen and helium rich white dwarf displaying neutral helium lines dao a hydrogen and helium rich white dwarf displaying ionized helium lines daz a hydrogen rich metallic white dwarf dbz a helium rich metallic white dwarf a different set of spectral peculiarity symbols are used for white dwarfs than for other types of stars code spectral peculiarities for stars p magnetic white dwarf with detectable polarization e emission lines present h magnetic white dwarf without detectable polarization v variable pec spectral peculiarities exist main articles neutron star black hole and exotic star stellar remnants are objects associated with the death of stars included in the category are white dwarfs and as can be seen from the radically different classification scheme for class d non stellar objects are difficult to fit into the mk system the hertzsprung russell diagram which the mk system is based on is observational in nature so these remnants cannot easily be plotted on the diagram or cannot be placed at all old neutron stars are relatively small and cold and would fall on the far right side of the diagram planetary nebulae are dynamic and tend to quickly fade in brightness as the progenitor star transitions to the white dwarf branch if shown a planetary nebula would be plotted to the right of the diagram s upper right quadrant a black hole emits no visible light of its own and therefore would not appear on the diagram several spectral types all previously used for non standard stars in the mid-20th century have been replaced during revisions of the stellar classification system they may still be found in old editions of star catalogs r and n have been subsumed into the new c class as c
