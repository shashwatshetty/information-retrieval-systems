observatory greenwich edmond or edmund halley frs 8 november o s 29 october 1656 25 january 1742 o s 14 january 1741 was an english astronomer geophysicist mathematician meteorologist and physicist who is best known for computing the orbit of halley s comet he was the second astronomer royal in britain succeeding john flamsteed contents halley was born in haggerston in east london his father edmond halley sr came from a derbyshire family and was a wealthy soap maker in london as a child halley was very interested in mathematics he studied at st paul s school and from 1673 at the queen s college oxford while still an undergraduate halley published papers on the solar system and sunspots while at oxford university halley was introduced to john flamsteed the astronomer royal influenced by flamsteed s project to compile a catalog of northern stars halley proposed to do the same for the southern hemisphere in 1676 halley visited the south atlantic island of saint helena and set up an observatory with a large sextant with telescopic sights to catalogue the stars of the southern hemisphere while there he observed a transit of mercury and realised that a similar transit of venus could be used to determine the absolute size of the solar system he returned to england in may 1678 in the following year he went to danzig gda sk on behalf of the royal society to help resolve a dispute because astronomer johannes hevelius did not use a telescope his observations had been questioned by robert hooke halley stayed with hevelius and he observed and verified the quality of hevelius observations in 1679 halley published the results from his observations on st helena as catalogus stellarum australium which included details of 341 southern stars these additions to contemporary star maps earned him comparison with tycho brahe e g the southern tycho as described by flamsteed halley was awarded his m a degree at oxford and elected as a fellow of the royal society at the age of 22 in september 1682 he carried out a series of observations of what became known as halley s comet though his name became associated with it because of his work on its orbit and predicting its return in 1758 which he did not live to see bust of halley royal observatory greenwich in 1686 halley published the second part of the results from his helenian expedition being a paper and chart on trade winds and monsoons the symbols he used to represent trailing winds still exist in most modern day weather chart representations in this article he identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions he also established the relationship between barometric pressure and height above sea level his charts were an important contribution to the emerging field of information visualisation halley spent most of his time on lunar observations but was also interested in the problems of gravity one problem that attracted his attention was the proof of kepler s laws of planetary motion in august 1684 he went to cambridge to discuss this with isaac newton much as john flamsteed had done four years earlier only to find that newton had solved the problem at the instigation of flamsteed with regard to the orbit of comet kirch without publishing the solution halley asked to see the calculations and was told by newton that he could not find them but promised to redo them and send them on later which he eventually did in a short treatise entitled on the motion of bodies in an orbit halley recognised the importance of the work and returned to cambridge to arrange its publication with newton who instead went on to expand it into his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica published at halley s expense in 1687 halley s first calculations with comets were thereby for the orbit of comet kirch based on flamsteed s observations in 1680-1 although he was to accurately calculate the orbit of the comet of 1682 he was inaccurate in his calculations of the orbit of comet kirch they indicated a periodicity of 575 years thus appearing in the years 531 and 1106 and presumably heralding the death of julius caesar in a like fashion in 44 45 bce it is now known to have an orbital period of circa 10,000 years in 1691 halley built a diving bell a device in which the atmosphere was replenished by way of weighted barrels of air sent down from the surface in a demonstration halley and five companions dived to 60 feet 18 m in the river thames and remained there for over an hour and a half halley s bell was of little use for practical salvage work as it was very heavy but he made improvements to it over time later extending his underwater exposure time to over 4 hours halley suffered one of the earliest recorded cases of middle ear barotrauma that same year at a meeting of the royal society halley introduced a rudimentary working model of a magnetic compass using a liquid filled housing to damp the swing and wobble of the magnetised needle in 1691 halley sought the post of savilian professor of astronomy at oxford while a candidate for the position halley faced the animosity of the astronomer royal john flamsteed and his religious views were questioned his candidacy was opposed by both the archbishop of canterbury john tillotson and bishop stillingfleet and the post went instead to david gregory who had the support of isaac newton in 1692 halley put forth the idea of a hollow earth consisting of a shell about 500 miles 800 km thick two inner concentric shells and an innermost core he suggested that atmospheres separated these shells and that each shell had its own magnetic poles with each sphere rotating at a different speed halley proposed this scheme to explain anomalous compass readings he envisaged each inner region as having an atmosphere and being luminous and possibly inhabited and speculated that escaping gas caused the aurora borealis in 1693 halley published an article on life annuities which featured an analysis of age at death on the basis of the breslau statistics caspar neumann had been able to provide this article allowed the british government to sell life annuities at an appropriate price based on the age of the purchaser halley s work strongly influenced the development of actuarial science the construction of the life table for breslau which followed more primitive work by john graunt is now seen as a major event in the history of demography the royal society censured halley for suggesting in 1694 that the story of noah s flood might be an account of a cometary impact however he was to be vindicated less than three centuries later after the publication of und die sintflut gab es doch by professors alexander edith tollmann of the university of vienna their book presents evidence from the geologic record that a comet had split up and then struck the earth in shoemaker levy fashion about 10 millennia ago in 1698 halley was given command of the paramour a 52 feet 16 m pink so that he could carry out investigations in the south atlantic into the laws governing the variation of the compass on 19 august 1698 he took command of the ship and in november 1698 sailed on what was the first purely scientific voyage by an english naval vessel unfortunately problems of insubordination arose over questions of halley s competence to command a vessel halley returned the ship to england to proceed against officers in july 1699 the result was a mild rebuke for his men and dissatisfaction for halley who felt the court had been too lenient halley thereafter received a temporary commission as a captain in the royal navy recommissioned the paramour on 24 august 1699 and sailed again in september 1699 to make extensive observations on the conditions of terrestrial magnetism this task he accomplished in a second atlantic voyage which lasted until 6 september 1700 and extended from 52 degrees north to 52 degrees south the results were published in general chart of the variation of the compass 1701 this was the first such chart to be published and the first on which isogonic or halleyan lines appeared plaque in south cloister of westminster abbey the preface to awnsham and john churchill s collection of voyages and travels 1704 supposedly written by john locke or by halley made the link natural and moral history is embellished with the most beneficial increase of so many thousands of plants it had never before received so many drugs and spices such unaccountable diversity trade is raised to highest pitch and this not in a niggard and scanty manner

buried there but at st margaret s lee some 30 minutes walk away in november 1703 halley was appointed savilian professor of geometry at the university of oxford his theological enemies john tillotson and bishop stillingfleet having died and received an honorary degree of doctor of laws in 1710 in 1705 applying historical astronomy methods he published synopsis astronomia cometicae which stated his belief that the comet sightings of 1456 1531 1607 and 1682 were of the same comet which he predicted would return in 1758 halley did not live to witness the comet s return but when it did the comet became generally known as halley s comet by 1706 halley had learned arabic and completed the translation started by edward bernard of books v vii of apollonius s conics from copies found at leiden and the bodleian library at oxford he also completed a new translation of the first four books from the original greek that had been started by the late david gregory he published these along with his own reconstruction of book viii in the first complete latin edition in 1710 in 1716 halley suggested a high precision measurement of the distance between the earth and the sun by timing the transit of venus in doing so he was following the method described by james gregory in optica promota in which the design of the gregorian telescope is also described it is reasonable to assume halley possessed and had read this book given that the gregorian design was the principal telescope design used in astronomy in halley s day it is not to halley s credit that he failed to acknowledge gregory s priority in this matter in 1718 he discovered the proper motion of the fixed stars by comparing his astrometric measurements with those given in ptolemy s almagest arcturus and sirius were two noted to have moved significantly the latter having progressed 30 arc minutes about the diameter of the moon southwards in 1800 years in 1720 together with his friend the antiquarian william stukeley halley participated in the first attempt to scientifically date stonehenge assuming that the monument had been laid out using a magnetic compass stukeley and halley attempted to calculate the perceived deviation introducing corrections from existing magnetic records and suggested three dates 460 bc 220 ad and 920 ad the earliest being the one accepted these dates were wrong by thousands of years but the idea that scientific methods could be used to date ancient monuments was revolutionary in its day halley succeeded john flamsteed in 1720 as astronomer royal a position halley held until his death halley s grave halley died in 1742 at the age of 85 he was buried in the graveyard of the old church of st margaret s lee since rebuilt at lee terrace blackheath he was interred in the same vault as the astronomer royal john pond the unmarked grave of the astronomer royal nathaniel bliss is nearby his original tombstone was transferred by the admiralty when the original lee church was demolished and rebuilt it can be seen today on the southern wall of the camera obscura at the royal observatory greenwich his marked grave can be seen at st margaret s church lee terrace halley married mary tooke in 1682 and settled in islington the couple had three children halley s map of the path of the solar eclipse of 3 may 1715 across england halley s comet orbital period approximately 75 years

halley s restaurant freehouse a pub in charlotte north carolina halley house school hackney london 2015 there are three pronunciations of the surname halley the most common both in great britain and in the united states is this is the personal pronunciation used by most halleys living in london today the alternative is often preferred for the man and the comet by those who grew up with rock and roll singer bill haley who called his backing band his comets after the common pronunciation of halley s comet in the united states at the time colin ronan one of halley s biographers preferred contemporary accounts spell his name hailey hayley haley haly halley hawley and hawly and presumably pronunciations varied similarly as for his given name although the spelling edmund is quite common edmond is what halley himself used according to a 1902 article though a 2007 international comet quarterly article disputes this commenting that in his published works he used edmund 22 times and edmond only 3 times with several other variations used as well such as the latinised edmundus much of the debate stems from the fact that in halley s own time english spelling conventions were not yet standardised and so he himself used multiple spellings geomagnetism wikipedia book history of geomagnetism armitage angus 1966 edmond halley london nelson coley noel 1986 halley and post restoration
