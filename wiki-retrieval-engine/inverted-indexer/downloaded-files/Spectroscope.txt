spectrometer spectrophotometer spectrograph or spectroscope is an instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum typically used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials the variable measured is most often the light s intensity but could also for instance be the polarization state the independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light or a unit directly proportional to the photon energy such as reciprocal centimeters or electron volts which has a reciprocal relationship to wavelength a spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities spectrometers may also operate over a wide range of non optical wavelengths from gamma rays and x rays into the far infrared if the instrument is designed to measure the spectrum in absolute units rather than relative units then it is typically called a spectrophotometer the majority of spectrophotometers are used in spectral regions near the visible spectrum in general any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum below optical frequencies that is at microwave and radio frequencies the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device spectrometers are used in many fields for example they are used in astronomy to analyze the radiation from astronomical objects and deduce chemical composition the spectrometer uses a prism or a grating to spread the light from a distant object into a spectrum this allows astronomers to detect many of the chemical elements by their characteristic spectral fingerprints if the object is glowing by itself it will show spectral lines caused by the glowing gas itself these lines are named for the elements which cause them such as the hydrogen alpha beta and gamma lines chemical compounds may also be identified by absorption typically these are dark bands in specific locations in the spectrum caused by energy being absorbed as light from other objects passes through a gas cloud much of our knowledge of the chemical makeup of the universe comes from spectra contents spectroscope other names spectrograph related items mass spectrograph comparison of different diffraction based spectrometers reflection optics refraction optics fiber integrated optics spectroscopes are often used in astronomy and some branches of chemistry early spectroscopes were simply prisms with graduations marking wavelengths of light modern spectroscopes generally use a diffraction grating a movable slit and some kind of photodetector all automated and controlled by a computer joseph von fraunhofer developed the first modern spectroscope by combining a prism diffraction slit and telescope in a manner that increased the spectral resolution and was reproducible in other laboratories fraunhofer also went on to invent the first diffraction spectroscope gustav robert kirchhoff and robert bunsen discovered the application of spectroscopes to chemical analysis and used this approach to discover caesium and rubidium kirchhoff and bunsen s analysis also enabled a chemical explanation of stellar spectra including fraunhofer lines when a material is heated to incandescence it emits light that is characteristic of the atomic makeup of the material particular light frequencies give rise to sharply defined bands on the scale which can be thought of as fingerprints for example the element sodium has a very characteristic double yellow band known as the sodium d lines at 588.9950 and 589.5924 nanometers the color of which will be familiar to anyone who has seen a low pressure sodium vapor lamp in the original spectroscope design in the early 19th century light entered a slit and a collimating lens transformed the light into a thin beam of parallel rays the light then passed through a prism in hand held spectroscopes usually an amici prism that refracted the beam into a spectrum because different wavelengths were refracted different amounts due to dispersion this image was then viewed through a tube with a scale that was transposed upon the spectral image enabling its direct measurement with the development of photographic film the more accurate spectrograph was created it was based on the same principle as the spectroscope but it had a camera in place of the viewing tube in recent years the electronic circuits built around the photomultiplier tube have replaced the camera allowing real time spectrographic analysis with far greater accuracy arrays of photosensors are also used in place of film in spectrographic systems such spectral analysis or spectroscopy has become an important scientific tool for analyzing the composition of unknown material and for studying astronomical phenomena and testing astronomical theories in modern spectrographs in the uv visible and near ir spectral ranges the spectrum is generally given in the form of photon number per unit wavelength nm or m wavenumber m 1 cm 1 frequency thz or energy ev with the units indicated by the abscissa in the mid to far ir spectra are typically expressed in units of watts per unit wavelength m or wavenumber cm 1 in many cases the spectrum is displayed with the units left implied such as digital counts per spectral channel a comparison of the four abscissa types typically used for visible spectrometers a comparison of the four abscissa types typically used for infrared spectrometers main article spectrograph a very simple spectroscope based on a prism a spectrograph is an instrument that separates an incoming wave into a frequency spectrum there are several kinds of machines referred to as spectrographs depending on the precise nature of the waves the first spectrographs used photographic paper as the detector the star spectral classification and discovery of the main sequence hubble s law and the hubble sequence were all made with spectrographs that used photographic paper the plant pigment phytochrome was discovered using a spectrograph that used living plants as the detector more recent spectrographs use electronic detectors such as ccds which can be used for both visible and uv light the exact choice of detector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded a spectrograph is
