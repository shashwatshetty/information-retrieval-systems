asteroid orbiting the sun between mars and jupiter it is the fourth brightest object in the asteroid belt it is classified as an s type asteroid meaning that it has a stony composition contents iris was discovered on august 13 1847 by j r hind from london uk it was hind s first asteroid discovery and the seventh asteroid to be discovered overall iris was named after the rainbow goddess iris in greek mythology who was a messenger to the gods especially hera her quality of attendant of hera was particularly appropriate to the circumstances of discovery as iris was spotted following 3 juno by less than an hour of right ascension juno is the roman equivalent of hera size comparison the first 10 asteroids profiled against earth s moon iris is fourth from the right iris is an s type asteroid its surface likely exhibits albedo differences with possibly a large bright area in the northern hemisphere overall the surface is very bright and is probably a mixture nickel iron metals and magnesium and iron silicates its spectrum is similar to that of l and ll chondrites with corrections for space weathering so it may be an important contributor of these meteorites planetary dynamics also indicates that it should be a significant source of meteorites among the s type asteroids iris ranks fifth in geometric mean diameter after eunomia juno amphitrite and herculina iris s bright surface and small distance from the sun make it the fourth brightest object in the asteroid belt after vesta ceres and pallas it has a mean opposition magnitude of 7.8 comparable to that of neptune and can easily be seen with binoculars at most oppositions at typical oppositions it marginally outshines the larger though darker pallas but at rare oppositions near perihelion iris can reach a magnitude of 6.7 next time on october 31 2017 reaching a magnitude of 6.9 which is as bright as ceres ever gets lightcurve analysis indicates a somewhat angular shape and that iris s pole points towards the ecliptic coordinates 10 20 with a 10 uncertainty this gives an axial tilt of 85 so that on almost a whole hemisphere of iris the sun does not set during summer and does not rise during winter on an airless body this gives rise to very large temperature differences the orbit of 7 iris compared with the orbits of earth mars and jupiter iris was observed occulting a star on may 26 1995 and later on july 25 1997 both observations gave a diameter of about 200 km former classification of planets shape model deduced from lightcurve m kaasalainen 2002 2011 feb-19 occultation durech model
