from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search typical lunar dome milichius pi about 11 km across a lunar dome is a type of shield volcano that is found on the surface of the earth s moon they are typically formed by highly viscous possibly silica rich lava erupting from localized vents followed by relatively slow cooling lunar domes are wide rounded circular features with a gentle slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint they are typically 8 12 km in diameter but can be up to 20 km across some of the domes contain a small craterlet at the peak some of the domes have been shown to consist of the same materials as the lunar maria thus they could be created by some mechanism that differs from the mare forming flows it is thought that these domes are formed from a smaller magma chamber that is closer to the surface than is the case for a mare this results in a lower pressure and so the lava flows more slowly the magma wells up through a crack in the surface but the flow eventually concentrates through one primary vent this concentration can then result in a vent crater at the peak of the dome the cluster of lunar domes at the marius hills was considered as a possible landing site of apollo 15 there are concentrations of lunar domes near the craters hortensius and t mayer across the top of mons r mker and in mare fecunditatis solitary lunar domes are also found including kies pi milichius pi mons gruithuisen gamma and delta and domes near the craters gambart c beer and capuanus omega cauchy and tau cauchy form a pair of domes near the crater cauchy likewise near arago are the domes arago alpha and arago beta there are two domes south of mons esam omega cauchy with the small crater donna at its summit mare tranquillitatis oblique view of a dome north of sinas mare tranquillitatis oblique view of lunar dome near messier in mare fecunditatis note dark halo deposits the crater left of center is unrelated formed after the dome lunar dome south of beer mare imbrium oblique view of three of the six lunar domes north of hortensius from lunar orbiter 3 lionel wilson and james w head lunar gruithuisen and mairan domes rheology and mode of emplacement journal of geophysical research vol 108 2003 lena r w hler c phillips j chiocchetta m t lunar domes properties and formation processes springer praxis books 2013 1 marvin w huddleston alpo lunar dome survey coordinator s web page on lunar domes association of lunar planetary observers lunar section glr group website uai lunar dome introduction retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title lunar dome oldid 819393882 categories geological features on the moonshield volcanoeslava domesextraterrestrial volcanoesgeologic domes
