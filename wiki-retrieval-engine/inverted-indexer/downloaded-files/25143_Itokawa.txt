itokawa japanese is a stony sub kilometer asteroid classified as near earth object of the apollo group and potentially hazardous asteroid that measures approximately 350 meters in diameter it was the first asteroid to be the target of a sample return mission the japanese space probe hayabusa and the smallest asteroid photographed and visited by a spacecraft contents the asteroid was discovered in 1998 by the linear project at the lincoln laboratory s experimental test site in socorro new mexico it was given the provisional designation this minor planet was named after hideo itokawa 1912 1999 a japanese rocket scientist the official naming citation was published in the minor planet center on 6 august 2003 itokawa is an s type asteroid radar imaging by goldstone in 2001 observed an ellipsoid 630 60 m long and 250 30 m wide the hayabusa mission confirmed these findings and also suggested that itokawa may be a contact binary formed by two or more smaller asteroids that have gravitated toward each other and stuck together the hayabusa images show a surprising lack of impact craters and a very rough surface studded with boulders described by the mission team as a rubble pile furthermore the density of the asteroid is too low for it to be made from solid rock this would mean that itokawa is not a monolith but rather a rubble pile formed from fragments that have cohered over time based on yarkovsky o keefe radzievskii paddack effect measurements a small section of itokawa is estimated to have a density of 2.9 g cm whereas a larger section is estimated to have a density of 1.8 g cm itokawa s orbit this artist s impression based on detailed spacecraft observations shows the strange peanut shaped asteroid itokawa in 2000 it was selected as the target of japan s hayabusa mission the probe arrived in the vicinity of itokawa on 12 september 2005 and initially parked in an asteroid sun line at 20 km 12 mi and later 7 km 4.3 mi from the asteroid itokawa s gravity was too weak to provide an orbit so the spacecraft adjusted its orbit around the sun until it matched the asteroid s hayabusa landed on 20 november for thirty minutes but it failed to operate a device designed to collect soil samples on 25 november a second landing and sampling sequence was attempted the sample capsule was returned to earth and landed at woomera south australia on 13 june 2010 around 13 51 utc 23 21 local on 16 november 2010 the japan aerospace exploration agency reported that dust collected during hayabusa s voyage was indeed from the asteroid names of major surface features were proposed by hayabusa scientists and accepted by the working group for planetary system nomenclature of the international astronomical union also the hayabusa science team is using working names for smaller surface features the following tables list the names of geological features on the asteroid no naming conventions have been disclosed for surface features on itokawa crater

science devoted six articles to findings based on dust that hayabusa had collected from itokawa scientists analysis suggested that itokawa was probably made up from interior fragments of a larger asteroid that broke apart dust collected from the asteroid surface is thought to have been exposed there for about eight million years scientists used varied techniques of chemistry and mineralogy to analyze the dust from itokawa itokawa s composition was found to match the common type of meteorites known as low total iron low metal ordinary chondrites another team of scientists determined that the dark iron color on the surface of itokawa was the result of abrasion by micrometeoroids and high speed particles from the sun which had converted the normally whitish iron oxide coloring durech j
