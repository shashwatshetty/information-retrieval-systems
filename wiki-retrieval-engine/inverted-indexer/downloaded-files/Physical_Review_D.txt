established in 1893 by edward nichols it publishes original research as well as scientific and literature reviews on all aspects of physics it is published by the american physical society aps the journal is in its third series and is split in several sub journals each covering a particular field of physics it has a sister journal physical review letters which publishes shorter articles of broader interest contents physical review commenced publication in july 1893 organized by cornell university professor edward nichols and helped by the new president of cornell j gould schurman the journal was managed and edited at cornell in upstate new york from 1893 to 1913 by nichols ernest merritt and frederick bedell the 33 volumes published during this time constitute physical review series i the american physical society aps founded in 1899 took over its publication in 1913 and started physical review series ii the journal remained at cornell under editor in chief g s fulcher from 1913 to 1926 before relocating to the location of editor john torrence tate sr at the university of minnesota in 1929 the aps started publishing reviews of modern physics a venue for longer review articles during the great depression wealthy scientist alfred loomis anonymously paid the journal s fees for authors who could not afford them after tate s death in 1950 the journals were managed on an interim basis still in minnesota by e l hill and j william buchta until samuel goudsmit and simon pasternack were appointed and the editorial office moved to brookhaven national laboratory on eastern long island new york in july 1958 the sister journal physical review letters was introduced to publish short articles of particularly broad interest initially edited by george l trigg who remained as editor until 1988 in 1970 physical review split into sub journals physical review a b c and d a fifth member of the family physical review e was introduced in 1993 to a large part to accommodate the huge amount of new research in nonlinear dynamics combined these constitute physical review series iii the editorial office moved in 1980 to its present location across the expressway from brookhaven national laboratory goudsmit retired in 1974 and pasternack in the mid-1970s past editors in chief include david lazarus 1980 1990 university of illinois at urbana champaign benjamin bederson 1990 1996 new york university martin blume 1996 2007 brookhaven national laboratory and gene sprouse 2007 2015 suny stony brook the current editor in chief is michael thoennessen whose term began in september 2017 to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the journal a memoir was published jointly by the aps and aip in 1998 the first issue of physical review special topics accelerators and beams was published and in 2005 physical review special topics physics education research was launched in january 2016 the names of both journals were changed to remove special topics physical review also started an online magazine physical review focus in 1998 to explain and provide historical context for selected articles from physical review and physical review letters this was merged into physics in 2011 the special topics journals are open access physics education research requires page charges from the authors but accelerators and beams does not though not fully open access physical review letters also requires an author page charge although this is voluntary the other journals require such a charge only if manuscripts are not prepared in one of the preferred formats authors can pay extra charges to make their papers open access such papers are published under the terms of the creative commons attribution 3.0 license cc by physical review letters celebrated their 50th birthday in 2008 the aps has a copyright policy to permit the author to reuse parts of the published article in a derivative or new work including on wikipedia the aps has an online publication entitled physics aiming to help physicists and physics students to learn about new developments outside of their own subfield this now includes the general interest articles that appeared as physical review focus it also publishes physical review x an online only gold open access journal it is a peer reviewed journal that publishes as timely as possible original research papers from all areas of pure applied and interdisciplinary physics in 2014 physical review applied began publishing research across all aspects of experimental and theoretical applications of physics including their interactions with other sciences engineering and industry in 2016 the aps launched physical review fluids to include additional areas of fluid dynamics research and in 2017 it launched
