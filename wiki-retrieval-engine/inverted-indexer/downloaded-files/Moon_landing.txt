the surface of the moon bottom left still frame from a video transmission taken moments before neil armstrong became the first human to step onto the surface of the moon at 02 56 utc on 21 july 1969 an estimated 500 million people worldwide watched this event the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time a moon landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the moon this includes both manned and unmanned robotic missions the first human made object to reach the surface of the moon was the soviet union s luna 2 mission on 13 september 1959 the united states apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the moon on 20 july 1969 there have been six manned u s landings between 1969 and 1972 and numerous unmanned landings with no soft landings happening from 22 august 1976 until 14 december 2013 to date the united states is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the moon with the last departing the lunar surface in december 1972 contents after the unsuccessful attempt by the luna 1 to land on the moon in 1959 the soviet union performed the first hard unpowered moon landing later that same year with the luna 2 spacecraft a feat the u s duplicated in 1962 with ranger 4 since then twelve soviet and u s spacecraft have used braking rockets to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface between 1966 and 1976 in 1966 the ussr accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the luna 9 and luna 13 missions the u s followed with five unmanned surveyor soft landings the soviet union achieved the first unmanned lunar soil sample return with the luna 16 probe on 24 september 1970 this was followed by luna 20 and luna 24 in 1972 and 1976 respectively following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first lunokhod luna e-8 no.201 the luna 17 and luna 21 were successful unmanned lunar rover missions in 1970 and 1973 many missions were failures at launch in addition several unmanned landing missions achieved the lunar surface but were unsuccessful including luna 15 luna 18 and luna 23 all crashed on landing and the u s surveyor 4 lost all radio contact only moments before its landing more recently other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the moon at speeds of around 8,000 kilometres per hour 5,000 mph often at precise planned locations these have generally been end of life lunar orbiters that because of system degradations could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations masscons to maintain their orbit japan s lunar orbiter hiten impacted the moon s surface on 10 april 1993 the european space agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter smart-1 on 3 september 2006 indian space research organisation isro performed a controlled crash impact with its moon impact probe mip on 14 november 2008 the mip was an ejected probe from the indian chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface the chinese lunar orbiter chang e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the moon on 1 march 2009 the rover mission chang e 3 was launched on 1 december 2013 and soft landed on 14 december the lunar surface through a lunar module window shortly after landing a total of twelve men have landed on the moon this was accomplished with two us pilot astronauts flying a lunar module on each of six nasa missions across a 41 month period starting on 20 july 1969 utc with neil armstrong and buzz aldrin on apollo 11 and ending on 14 december 1972 utc with gene cernan and jack schmitt on apollo 17 cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface all apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the command module the last three missions had a rover for increased mobility in order to go to the moon a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the earth the only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the earth s atmosphere upon approach of the target moon a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity in order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour 99 mph and be ruggedized to withstand a hard landing impact or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a soft landing which is the only viable option with human occupants the first three attempts by the u s to perform a successful hard moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed the soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966 followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the u s the speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100 of the escape velocity of the target moon and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon s gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur for earth s moon the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second 1.48 mi s the change in velocity referred to as a delta v is usually provided by a landing rocket which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft an exception is the soft moon landing on titan carried out by the huygens probe in 2005 as the moon with the thickest atmosphere landings on titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability the soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the moon in 1959 crash landings may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket there have been many such moon crashes often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface for example during the apollo program the s ivb third stage of the saturn v moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the lunar module were deliberately crashed on the moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the moon to return to earth the escape velocity of the moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the moon rockets must be used to leave the moon and return to space upon reaching earth atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing these functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the moon s surface by a moon landing rocket increasing the latter s required size the moon departure rocket larger moon landing rocket and any earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree main

become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era world war ii had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg style surprise attacks used in the invasion of poland and in the attack on pearl harbor the v-2 rocket a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on london and antwerp and the atom bomb which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in the 1950s tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the united states and the soviet union that had emerged as victors in the conflict particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb the first image of another world from space returned by luna 3 showed the far side of the moon in october 1959 willy ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the moon could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers on 4 october 1957 the soviet union launched sputnik 1 as the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth and so initiated the space race this unexpected event was a source of pride to the soviets and shock to the u s who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear tipped soviet rockets in under 30 minutes also the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard sputnik 1 as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides as effective propaganda to third world countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the soviet political system compared to that of the u s this perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid fire soviet space achievements in 1959 the r-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from earth s gravity into a solar orbit the first crash impact onto the surface of the moon and the first photography of the never before seen far side of the moon these were the luna 1 luna 2 and luna 3 spacecraft a 1963 conceptual model of the apollo lunar excursion module the u s response to these soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency nasa military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that would bridge the so called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the soviets known as mutual assured destruction or mad these newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of nasa for various projects which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload guidance accuracy and reliabilities of u s icbms to the soviets while nasa stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic goal oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure just as the soviets were doing with their r-7 luna 3 transmitted the first photos of the far side of the moon after the fall of the soviet union in 1991 historical records were released to allow the true accounting of soviet lunar efforts unlike the u s tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch the soviets assigned a public luna mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond earth orbit the policy had the effect of hiding soviet moon mission failures from public view if the attempt failed in earth orbit before departing for the moon it was frequently but not always given a sputnik or cosmos earth orbit mission number to hide its purpose launch explosions were not

to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions however rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions failures included three u s attempts

modified with an able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the moon s surface an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space a diaphragm microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites a magnetometer and temperature variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions the first a mission managed by the united states air force exploded during launch all subsequent pioneer lunar flights had nasa as the lead management organization the next two returned to earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres 68,000 mi and 1,450 kilometres 900 mi far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres 250,000 mi required to reach the vicinity of the moon nasa then collaborated with the united states army s ballistic missile agency to fly two extremely small cone shaped probes on the juno icbm carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a geiger m ller tube detector the first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres 62,000 mi serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the van allen radiation belts before reentering earth s atmosphere the second passed by the moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres 37,000 mi twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on board scientific instruments yet still becoming the first u s spacecraft to reach a solar orbit the final pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four paddlewheel solar panels extending from a one meter diameter spherical spin stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television like system estimate the moon s mass and topography of the poles record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites study radiation measure magnetic fields detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well none of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its atlas icbm outfitted with an able upper stage following the unsuccessful atlas able pioneer probes nasa s jet propulsion laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions the interplanetary versions were known as mariners lunar versions were rangers jpl envisioned three versions of the ranger lunar probes block i prototypes which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high earth orbit that came nowhere near the moon block ii which would try to accomplish the first moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package and block iii which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide area photographs of the moon during their descent see also ranger program the ranger 1 and 2 block i missions were virtually identical spacecraft experiments included a lyman alpha telescope a rubidium vapor magnetometer electrostatic analyzers medium energy range particle detectors two triple coincidence telescopes a cosmic ray integrating ionization chamber cosmic dust detectors and scintillation counters the goal was to place these block i spacecraft in a very high earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres 68,000 mi and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres 37,000 mi from that vantage point scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high bandwidth television transmissions from the moon during a one shot fifteen minute time window in subsequent block ii and block iii lunar descents both block i missions suffered failures of the new agena upper stage and never left low earth parking orbit after launch both burned up upon reentry after only a few days the first attempts to perform a moon landing took place in 1962 during the rangers 3 4 and 5 missions flown by the united states all three block ii missions basic vehicles were 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact limiter 650 mm in diameter a mono propellant mid course motor a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds force 22.5 kn and a gold and chrome plated hexagonal base 1.5 m in diameter this lander code named tonto was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon a 42 kg 56 pounds 30 centimetre diameter 0.98 ft metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere this payload sphere contained six silver cadmium batteries to power a fifty milliwatt radio transmitter a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5 lb 2.3 kg meteorite on the opposite side of the moon weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere after landing plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere the batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere various mission constraints limited the landing site to oceanus procellarum on the lunar equator which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch no cameras were carried by the ranger landers and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission instead the 3.1 metres 10 ft ranger block ii mother ship carried a 200 scan line television camera which was to capture images during the free fall descent to the lunar surface the camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds seconds before impact at 5 and 0.6 kilometres 3.11 and 0.37 mi above the lunar surface the ranger mother ships took picture which may be viewed here other instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter the radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid fueled braking rocket overboard from the block ii mother ship the braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres 1,080 ft above the surface and separate allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface on ranger 3 failure of the atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the moon attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the moon were thwarted by in flight failure of the onboard flight computer this was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground to protect the moon from being contaminated by earth organisms heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in flight failures of the spacecraft computer on ranger 4 and the power subsystem on ranger 5 only ranger 4 reached the moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the moon heat sterilization was discontinued for the final four block iii ranger probes these replaced the block ii landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming apollo manned moon landing missions six cameras were designed to take thousands of high altitude photographs in the final twenty minute period before crashing on the lunar surface camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical u s 1964 home television while ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight the subsequent ranger 7 mission to mare cognitum was a complete success breaking the six year string of failures in u s attempts to photograph the moon at close range the ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 nasa budget appropriation to pass through the united states congress intact without a reduction in funds for the apollo manned moon landing program subsequent successes with ranger 8 and ranger 9 further buoyed u s hopes model of luna 16 moon soil sample return lander model of soviet lunokhod automatic moon rover the luna 9 spacecraft launched by the soviet union performed the first successful soft moon landing on 3 february 1966 airbags protected its 99 kilograms 218 lb ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second 54 km h luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar moon landing on 24 december 1966 both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface luna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to earth it represented the first lunar sample return mission by the soviet union and was the third lunar sample return mission overall following the apollo 11 and apollo 12 missions this mission was later successfully repeated by luna 20 1972 and luna 24 1976 in 1970 and 1973 two lunokhod moonwalker robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the moon where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively covering 10.5 km lunokhod 1 and 37 km lunokhod 2 these rover missions were

general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the moon these pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight however the luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50 kilometres 31 mi per hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 ranger landing attempts and their planned 160 kilometres 99 mi per hour impacts than with the surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar controlled adjustable thrust retrorocket while luna 9 and surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments only surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight thus as of mid-1966 the united states had begun to pull ahead of the soviet union in the so called space race to land a man on the moon a timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975 with missions from the usa and ussr advances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the moon of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit ranger surveyor and initial luna moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one way trip in contrast manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to earth for the crew leaving this massive amount of required earth return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again working against lunar gravity both ways such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned moon landing accordingly beginning in mid-1966 both the u s and u s s r naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned moon landing the primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and for the soviets the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings an unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the moon s maria such mass concentrations mascons can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low altitude satellites around the moon making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years controlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value for example in 1999 the nasa lunar prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of shoemaker crater near the lunar south pole it was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from earth no such plume was observed however a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist eugene shoemaker was delivered by the lunar prospector to the crater named in his honor currently the only

manned lunar programs zond mounted on top stage of proton booster in assembly hangar it is possible to aim a spacecraft from earth so that it will loop around the moon and return to earth without entering lunar orbit following the so called free return trajectory such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and earth return are not required however a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low earth orbit mission offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned moon landing foremost among these are mastering the demands of re entering the earth s atmosphere upon returning from the moon manned earth orbiting vehicles such as the space shuttle return to earth from speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour 27,000 km h 7,600 m s due to the effects of gravity a vehicle returning from the moon hits earth s atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 25,000 miles per hour 40,000 km h 11,000 m s the g loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force achieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the soviets with their zond spacecraft program the first three zonds were unmanned planetary probes after that the zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program the initial focus of these later zonds was extensive testing of required high speed reentry techniques this focus was not shared by the u s who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose initial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low earth orbit during the soviet vostok and u s mercury programs a two flight extension of the vostok program known as voskhod effectively used vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965 these capabilities were later demonstrated by the u s in ten gemini low earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966 using a totally new second generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier mercury these gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile after the end of the gemini program the soviets union began flying their second generation zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the moon and returning him immediately to earth the zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational proton launch rocket unlike the parallel soviet manned moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third generation soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced n-1 booster the soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned zond circumlunar flight years before a u s manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory however significant development problems delayed the zond program and the success of the u s apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the zond effort like zond apollo moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a service module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned this option was implemented after an explosion aboard the apollo 13 mission in 1970 which is the only

indian ocean zond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from earth to the vicinity of the moon and return initiating the final lap of the space race with its payload of turtles insects plants and bacteria despite the failure suffered in its final moments the zond 6 mission was reported by soviet media as being a success as well although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements both of these zond missions flew off nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard as a result the soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated however due to nasa s continuing problems with the lunar module and because of cia reports of a potential soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968 nasa fatefully changed the flight plan of apollo 8 from an earth orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late december 1968 in early december 1968 the launch window to the moon opened for the soviet launch site in baikonur giving the ussr their final chance to beat the us to the moon cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the zond spacecraft then in final countdown at baikonur on the first manned trip to the moon ultimately however the soviet politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of zond proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned soviet lunar mission their decision proved to be a wise one since this unnumbered zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later by this time flights of the third generation u s apollo spacecraft had begun far more capable than the zond the apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to earth the apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the moon on 24 december 1968 certifying the saturn v booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the moon before returning safely to earth apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned moon landing in may 1969 this mission orbited within 47,400 feet 14.4 km altitude above the lunar surface performing necessary low altitude mapping of trajectory altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing with the failure of the unmanned soviet sample return moon landing attempt luna 15 in july 1969 the stage was set for apollo 11 the u s saturn v and the soviet n1 main article apollo program political pressure builds plans for manned moon exploration originated during the eisenhower administration in a series of mid-1950s articles in collier s magazine wernher von braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the moon to establish a lunar base a manned moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the us and ussr besides guidance and weight management atmospheric re entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle after the soviet union s launch of sputnik von braun promoted a plan for the united states army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965 after the early soviet successes especially yuri gagarin s flight us president john f kennedy looked for a us project that would capture the public imagination he asked vice president lyndon johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove us world leadership the proposals included non space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the third world the soviets at the time had more powerful rockets than the united states which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission advances in us nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller lighter warheads and consequently rockets with smaller payload capacities by comparison soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier and the powerful r-7 rocket was developed to carry them more modest potential missions such as flying around the moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit both were proposed by kennedy to von braun were determined to offer too much advantage to the soviets since the us would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the soviets a moon landing however would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda apollo landing sites johnson had championed the us manned space program ever since the sputnik scare sponsoring the legislation which created nasa when he was in the senate in 1958 when kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the soviets lead johnson responded that the us had an even chance of beating the ussr to a manned lunar landing but not for anything less kennedy seized on apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space he ensured continuing funding shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut but diverting money from other nasa scientific projects this last dismayed nasa s leader james e webb who perceived the need for nasa s support from the scientific community the moon landing required development of the large saturn v launch vehicle which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle caused mission failures in thirteen launches for the program to succeed its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left who wanted more money spent on social programs and on those on the right who favored a more military project by emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of soviet space dominance kennedy and johnson managed to swing public opinion by 1965 58 percent of americans favored apollo up from 33 percent two years earlier after johnson became president in 1963 his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969 as kennedy planned main article soviet moonshot soviet leader nikita khrushchev said in october 1963 that the ussr was not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the moon while insisting that the soviets had not dropped out of the race only after another year would the ussr fully commit itself to a moon landing attempt which ultimately failed at the same time kennedy had suggested various joint programs including a possible moon landing by soviet and u s astronauts and the development of better weather monitoring satellites khrushchev sensing an attempt by kennedy to steal russian space technology rejected the idea if the ussr went to the moon it would go alone sergey korolev the soviet space program s chief designer had started promoting his soyuz craft and the n1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned moon landing khrushchev directed korolev s design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing vostok technology while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft the proton booster and the zond for a manned cislunar flight in 1966 in 1964 the new soviet leadership gave korolev the backing for a moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction with korolev s death and the failure of the first soyuz flight in 1967 the co ordination of the soviet moon landing program quickly unraveled the soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed aleksei leonov on the moon s surface but with the successive launch failures of the n1 booster in 1969 plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation in total twenty four u s astronauts have traveled to the moon three have made the trip twice and twelve have walked on its surface apollo 8 was a lunar orbit only mission apollo 10 included undocking and descent orbit insertion doi followed by lm staging to csm redocking while apollo 13 originally scheduled as a landing ended up as a lunar fly by by means of free return trajectory thus none of these missions made landings apollo 7 and apollo 9 were earth orbit only missions apart from the inherent dangers of manned moon expeditions as seen with apollo 13 one reason for their cessation according to astronaut alan bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies mission name

and aldrin became marooned on the moon s surface and could not be rescued in 1951 science fiction writer arthur c clarke forecast that man would reach the moon by 1978 on 16 august 2006 the associated press reported that nasa is missing the original slow scan television tapes which were made before the scan conversion for conventional tv of the apollo 11 moon walk some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the sstv tapes were found in western australia but those tapes were only recordings of data from the apollo 11 early apollo surface experiments package scientists believe the six
