from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search apollo 12 lunar module intrepid prepares to descend towards the surface of the moon nasa photo the physical exploration of the moon began when luna 2 a space probe launched by the soviet union made an impact on the surface of the moon on september 14 1959 prior to that the only available means of exploration had been observation from earth the invention of the optical telescope brought about the first leap in the quality of lunar observations galileo galilei is generally credited as the first person to use a telescope for astronomical purposes having made his own telescope in 1609 the mountains and craters on the lunar surface were among his first observations using it nasa s apollo program was the first and to date only mission to successfully land humans on the moon the first landing took place in 1969 when astronauts placed scientific instruments and returned lunar samples to earth contents see also selenography and lunar theory a study of the moon from robert hooke s micrographia 1665 the ancient greek philosopher anaxagoras d 428 bc reasoned that the sun and moon were both giant spherical rocks and that the latter reflected the light of the former his non religious view of the heavens was one cause for his imprisonment and eventual exile in his little book on the face in the moon s orb plutarch suggested that the moon had deep recesses in which the light of the sun did not reach and that the spots are nothing but the shadows of rivers or deep chasms he also entertained the possibility that the moon was inhabited aristarchus went a step further and computed the distance from earth together with its size obtaining a value of 20 times the earth radius for the distance the real value is 60 the earth radius was roughly known since eratosthenes although the chinese of the han dynasty 202 bc 202 ad believed the moon to be energy equated to qi their radiating influence theory recognized that the light of the moon was merely a reflection of the sun mentioned by anaxagoras above this was supported by mainstream thinkers such as jing fang who noted the sphericity of the moon shen kuo 1031 1095 of the song dynasty 960 1279 created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the moon to a round ball of reflective silver that when doused with white powder and viewed from the side would appear to be a crescent by 499 ad the indian astronomer aryabhata mentioned in his aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause behind the shining of the moon the earliest surviving daguerrotype of the moon by john w draper 1840 photo of the moon made by lewis rutherfurd in 1865 habash al hasib al marwazi a persian astronomer conducted various observations at the al shammisiyyah observatory in baghdad between 825 and 835 ad using these observations he estimated the moon s diameter as 3,037 km equivalent to 1,519 km radius and its distance from the earth as 346,345 km 215,209 mi which come close to the currently accepted values in the 11th century the islamic physicist alhazen investigated moonlight which he proved through experimentation originates from sunlight and correctly concluded that it emits light from those portions of its surface which the sun s light strikes by the middle ages before the invention of the telescope an increasing number of people began to recognise the moon as a sphere though many believed that it was perfectly smooth in 1609 galileo galilei drew one of the first telescopic drawings of the moon in his book and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters later in the 17th century giovanni battista riccioli and francesco maria grimaldi drew a map of the moon and gave many craters the names they still have today on maps the dark parts of the moon s surface were called maria singular mare or seas and the light parts were called terrae or continents thomas harriot as well as galilei drew the first telescopic representation of the moon and observed it for several years his drawings however remained unpublished the first map of the moon was made by the belgian cosmographer and astronomer michael florent van langren in 1645 two years later a much more influential effort was published by johannes hevelius in 1647 hevelius published selenographia the first treatise entirely devoted to the moon hevelius s nomenclature although used in protestant countries until the eighteenth century was replaced by the system published in 1651 by the jesuit astronomer giovanni battista riccioli who gave the large naked eye spots the names of seas and the telescopic spots now called craters the name of philosophers and astronomers in 1753 the croatian jesuit and astronomer roger joseph boscovich discovered the absence of atmosphere on the moon in 1824 franz von gruithuisen explained the formation of craters as a result of meteorite strikes the possibility that the moon contains vegetation and is inhabited by selenites was seriously considered by major astronomers even into the first decades of the 19th century in 1834 1836 wilhelm beer and johann heinrich m dler published their four volume and the book in 1837 which firmly established the conclusion that the moon has no bodies of water nor any appreciable atmosphere main articles space race and moon landing see also soviet manned lunar programs the cold war inspired space race and moon race between the soviet union and the united states of america accelerated with a focus on the moon this included many scientifically important firsts such as the first photographs of the then unseen far side of the moon in 1959 by the soviet union and culminated with the landing of the first humans on the moon in 1969 widely seen around the world as one of the pivotal events of the 20th century and indeed of human history in general the first image returned of another world from space showed the moon s far side apollo 17 astronaut harrison schmitt standing next to a boulder at taurus littrow during the third eva extravehicular activity nasa photo the first man made object to reach the moon was the unmanned soviet probe luna 2 which made a hard landing on september 14 1959 at 21 02 24 z the far side of the moon was first photographed on october 7 1959 by the soviet probe luna 3 though vague by today s standards the photos showed that the far side of the moon almost completely lacked maria in an effort to compete with these soviet successes u s president john f kennedy proposed the national goal of landing a human on the moon speaking to a joint session of congress on may 25 1961 he said first i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long range exploration of space the soviets nonetheless remained in the lead for some time luna 9 was the first probe to soft land on the moon and transmit pictures from the lunar surface on february 3 1966 it was proven that a lunar lander would not sink into a thick layer of dust as had been feared the first artificial satellite of the moon was the soviet probe luna 10 launched march 31 1966 on december 24 1968 the crew of apollo 8 frank borman james lovell and william anders became the first human beings to enter lunar orbit and see the far side of the moon in person humans first landed on the moon on july 20 1969 the first human to walk on the lunar surface was neil armstrong commander of the u s mission apollo 11 the first robot lunar rover to land on the moon was the soviet vessel lunokhod 1 on november 17 1970 as part of the lunokhod programme to date the last human to stand on the moon was eugene cernan who as part of the mission apollo 17 walked on the moon in december 1972 see also a full list of lunar apollo astronauts moon rock samples were brought back to earth by three luna missions luna 16 20 and 24 and the apollo missions 11 through 17 except apollo 13 which aborted its planned lunar landing from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s there were 65 moon landings with 10 in 1971 alone but after luna 24 in 1976 they suddenly stopped the soviet union started focusing on venus and space stations and the u s on mars and beyond and on the skylab and space shuttle programs before the moon race the us had pre projects for scientific and military moonbases the lunex project and project horizon besides manned landings the abandoned soviet manned lunar programs included the building of a multipurpose moonbase zvezda the first detailed project complete with developed mockups of expedition vehicles and surface modules cassini huygens took this image during its lunar flyby before it traveled to saturn in 1990 japan visited the moon with the hiten spacecraft becoming the third country to place an object in orbit around the moon the spacecraft released the hagoromo probe into lunar orbit but the transmitter failed thereby preventing further scientific use of the mission in september 2007 japan launched the selene spacecraft with the objectives to obtain scientific data of the lunar origin and evolution and to develop the technology for the future lunar exploration according to the jaxa official website the european space agency launched a small low cost lunar orbital probe called smart 1 on september 27 2003 smart 1 s primary goal was to take three dimensional x ray and infrared imagery of the lunar surface smart 1 entered lunar orbit on november 15 2004 and continued to make observations until september 3 2006 when it was intentionally crashed into the lunar surface in order to study the impact plume china has begun the chinese lunar exploration program for exploring the moon and is investigating the prospect of lunar mining specifically looking for the isotope helium-3 for use as an energy source on earth china launched the chang e 1 robotic lunar orbiter on october 24 2007 originally planned for a one year mission the chang e 1 mission was very successful and ended up being extended for another four months on march 1 2009 chang e 1 was intentionally impacted on the lunar surface completing the 16 month mission on october 1 2010 china launched the chang e 2 lunar orbiter china landed the rover chang e 3 on the moon on december 14 2013 became the third country to have done so chang e 3 is the first spacecraft to soft land on lunar surface since luna 24 in 1976 india s national space agency indian space research organisation isro launched chandrayaan-1 an unmanned lunar orbiter on october 22 2008 the lunar probe was originally intended to orbit the moon for two years with scientific objectives to prepare a three dimensional atlas of the near and far side of the moon and to conduct a chemical and mineralogical mapping of the lunar surface the unmanned moon impact probe landed on the moon at 15 04 gmt on november 14 2008 making india the fourth country to touch down on the lunar surface among its many achievements was the discovery of the widespread presence of water molecules in lunar soil the ballistic missile defense organization and nasa launched the clementine mission in 1994 and lunar prospector in 1998 nasa launched the lunar reconnaissance orbiter on june 18 2009 which has collected imagery of the moon s surface it also carried the lunar crater observation and sensing satellite lcross which investigated the possible existence of water in cabeus crater grail is another mission launched in 2011 the first commercial mission to the moon was accomplished by the manfred memorial moon mission 4m led by luxspace an affiliate of german ohb ag the mission was carried on the chinese chang e 5 t1 test spacecraft which was launched on 23 october 2014 the 4m spacecraft made a moon flyby on a night of 28 october 2014 after which it entered elliptical earth orbit exceeding its designed lifetime by four times see also list of current and future lunar missions the nasa lunar reconnaissance orbiter following the abandoned us constellation program plans for manned flights followed by moonbases were declared by russia europe esa china japan and india all of them intend to continue the exploration of moon with more unmanned spacecraft china planned to conduct a sample return mission with its chang e 5 spacecraft in 2017 but that mission has been postponed until 2019 due to the 2017 failure of the long march 5 launch vehicle it will also send chang e 4 the backup model of the chang e 3 lander to the lunar farside in 2018 since the chang e 3 mission was a success the backup lander chang e 4 is re purposed for the mission to the farside which will be the first time it is attempted by any of the space faring countries india expects to launch another lunar mission by 2018 the chandrayaan-2 which would place a motorized rover on the moon japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa plans a manned lunar landing around 2020 that would lead to a manned lunar base by 2030 however there is no budget yet for this project and the plan reverts to robotic missions russia also announced to resume its previously frozen project luna glob an unmanned lander and orbiter which is slated to launch in 2016 in 2015 roscosmos stated that russia plans to place an astronaut on the moon by 2030 leaving mars to nasa the purpose is to work jointly with nasa and avoid a space race germany also announced in march 2007 that it would launch a national lunar orbiter leo in 2012 however the mission was cancelled due to budgetary constraints in august 2007 nasa stated that all future missions and explorations of the moon will be done entirely using the metric system this was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries which already use the metric system the european space agency has also announced its intention to send a manned mission to the moon as part of the aurora programme in september 2010 the agency introduced a lunar lander programme with a target of autonomous mission to the moon in 2018 on september 13 2007 the x prize foundation in concert with google inc announced the google lunar x prize this contest requires competitors to land a privately funded robotic rover on the moon that is capable of completing several mission objectives including roaming the lunar surface for at least 500 meters and sending video images and data back to the earth in march 2014 spacex indicated that while their current focus is not on lunar space transport they will consider commercial launch contracts for one off moon missions mission 1950 1959 launch arrival at moon
