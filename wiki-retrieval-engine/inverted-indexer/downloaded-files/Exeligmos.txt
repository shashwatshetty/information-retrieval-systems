from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search an exeligmos greek turning of the wheel is a period of 54 years 33 days that can be used to predict successive eclipses with similar properties and location for a solar eclipse after every exeligmos a solar eclipse of similar characteristics will occur in a location close to the eclipse before it for a lunar eclipse the same part of the earth will view an eclipse that is very similar to the one that occurred one exeligmos before it see main text for visual examples it is an eclipse cycle that is a triple saros 3 saroses or saroi long with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of days so the next eclipse will be visible at locations and times near the eclipse that occurred one exeligmos earlier in contrast each saros an eclipse occurs about 8 hours later in the day or about 120 to the west of the eclipse that occurred one saros earlier contents the greeks had knowledge of the exeligmos by at latest 100 bc a greek astronomical clock called the antikythera mechanism used epicyclic gearing to predict the dates of consecutive exeligmoses the exeligmos is 669 synodic months every eclipse cycle must be an integer number of synodic months almost exactly 726 draconic months which ensures the sun and moon are in alignment during the new moon and also almost exactly 717 anomalistic months ensuring the moon is at the same point of its elliptic orbit the first two factors make this a long lasting eclipse series the latter factor is what makes each eclipse in an exeligmos so similar the near integer number of anomalistic months ensures that the apparent diameter of the moon will be nearly the same with each successive eclipse the fact that it is very nearly a whole integer of days ensures each successive eclipse in the series occurs very close to the previous eclipse in the series for each successive eclipse in an exeligmos series the longitude and latitude can change significantly because an exeligmos is over a month longer than a calendar year and the gamma increases decreases because an exeligmos is about three hours shorter than a draconic month the sun s apparent diameter also changes significantly in one month affecting the length and width of a solar eclipse here is a comparison of two total solar eclipses one exeligmos apart march 7 1970 april 8 2024 path map total
