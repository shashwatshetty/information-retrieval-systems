turkish empire or simply turkey was a state that controlled much of southeastern europe western asia and northern africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries it was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern anatolia in the town of s t modern day bilecik province by the oghuz turkish tribal leader osman after 1354 the ottomans crossed into europe and with the conquest of the balkans the ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire the ottomans ended the byzantine empire with the 1453 conquest of constantinople by mehmed the conqueror during the 16th and 17th centuries at the height of its power under the reign of suleiman the magnificent the ottoman empire was a multinational multilingual empire controlling most of southeast europe parts of central europe western asia parts of eastern europe and the caucasus north africa and the horn of africa at the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states some of these were later absorbed into the ottoman empire while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries with constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the mediterranean basin the ottoman empire was at the centre of interactions between the eastern and western worlds for six centuries while the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of suleiman the magnificent this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians the empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy society and military throughout the seventeenth and much of the eighteenth century however during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 the ottoman military system fell behind that of their european rivals the habsburg and russian empires the ottomans consequently suffered severe military defeats in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries which prompted them to initiate a comprehensive process of reform and modernisation known as the tanzimat thus over the course of the nineteenth century the ottoman state became vastly more powerful and organised despite suffering further territorial losses especially in the balkans where a number of new states emerged the empire allied with germany in the early 20th century hoping to escape from the diplomatic isolation which had contributed to its recent territorial losses and thus joined world war i on the side of the central powers while the empire was able to largely hold its own during the conflict it was struggling with internal dissent especially with the arab revolt in its arabian holdings during this time major atrocities were committed by the ottoman government against the armenians assyrians and pontic greeks the empire s defeat and the occupation of part of its territory by the allied powers in the aftermath of world war i resulted in its partitioning and the loss of its middle eastern territories which were divided between the united kingdom and france the successful turkish war of independence against the occupying allies led to the emergence of the republic of turkey in the anatolian heartland and the abolition of the ottoman monarchy contents main article names of the ottoman empire the word ottoman is a historical anglicisation of the name of osman i the founder of the empire and of the ruling house of osman also known as the ottoman dynasty osman s name in turn was the turkish form of the arabic name uthm n in ottoman turkish the empire was referred to as devlet i al ye yi osm n ye literally the supreme ottoman state or alternatively osm nl devleti in modern turkish it is known as osmanl mparatorlu u the ottoman empire or osmanl devleti the ottoman state the turkish word for ottoman osmanl originally referred to the tribal followers of osman in the fourteenth century and subsequently came to be used to refer to the empire s military administrative elite in contrast the term turk t rk was used to refer to the anatolian peasant and tribal population and was seen as a disparaging term when applied to urban educated individuals in the early modern period an educated urban dwelling turkish speaker who was not a member of the military administrative class would refer to himself neither as an osmanl nor as a t rk but rather as a r m or roman meaning an inhabitant of the territory of the former byzantine empire in the balkans and anatolia the term r m was also used to refer to turkish speakers by the other muslim peoples of the empire and beyond in western europe the two names ottoman empire and turkey were often used interchangeably with turkey being increasingly favoured both in formal and informal situations this dichotomy was officially ended in 1920 23 when the newly established ankara based turkish government chose turkey as the sole official name most scholarly historians avoid the terms turkey turks and turkish when referring to the ottomans due to the empire s multinational character main article history of the ottoman empire see also territorial evolution of the ottoman empire main article rise of the ottoman empire further information osman i ottoman dynasty and gaza thesis as the power of the seljuk sultanate of rum declined in the 13th century anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent turkish principalities known as the anatolian beyliks one of these beyliks in the region of bithynia on the frontier of the byzantine empire was led by the turkish tribal leader osman d 1323 4 a figure of obscure origins from whom the name ottoman is derived osman s early followers consisted both of turkish tribal groups and byzantine renegades many but not all converts to islam osman extended the control of his principality by conquering byzantine towns along the sakarya river it is not well understood how the early ottomans came to dominate their neighbours due to the scarcity of the sources which survive from this period one school of thought which was popular during the twentieth century argued that the ottomans achieved success by rallying religious warriors to fight for them in the name of islam this theory known as the gaza thesis is now highly criticised and no longer generally accepted by historians but no consensus on the nature of the early ottoman state has yet emerged to replace it battle of nicopolis in 1396 painting from 1523 in the century after the death of osman i ottoman rule began to extend over anatolia and the balkans osman s son orhan captured the northwestern anatolian city of bursa in 1326 and made it the new capital of the ottoman state this conquest meant the loss of byzantine control over northwestern anatolia the important city of thessaloniki was captured from the venetians in 1387 the ottoman victory at kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of serbian power in the region paving the way for ottoman expansion into europe the battle of nicopolis in 1396 widely regarded as the last large scale crusade of the middle ages failed to stop the advance of the victorious ottoman turks with the extension of turkish dominion into the balkans the strategic conquest of constantinople became a crucial objective however the city s strategic position on the bosphorus strait and defensive military features made it difficult to conquer the empire had managed to control nearly all former byzantine lands surrounding the city but in 1402 the byzantines were temporarily relieved when the turco mongol leader timur founder of the timurid empire invaded anatolia from the east in the battle of ankara in 1402 timur defeated the ottoman forces and took sultan bayezid i as a prisoner throwing the empire into disorder the ensuing civil war lasted from 1402 to 1413 as bayezid s sons fought over succession it ended when mehmed i emerged as the sultan and restored ottoman power bringing an end to the interregnum also known as the fetret devri part of the ottoman territories in the balkans such as thessaloniki macedonia and kosovo were temporarily lost after 1402 but were later recovered by murad ii between the 1430s and 1450s on 10 november 1444 murad ii defeated the hungarian polish and wallachian armies under w adys aw iii of poland also king of hungary and john hunyadi at the battle of varna the final battle of the crusade of varna although albanians under skanderbeg continued to resist four years later john hunyadi prepared another army of hungarian and wallachian forces to attack the turks but was again defeated by murad ii at the second battle of kosovo in 1448 main article growth of the ottoman empire sultan mehmed ii s entry into constantinople painting by fausto zonaro 1854 1929 the son of murad ii mehmed the conqueror reorganized the state and the military and conquered constantinople on 29 may 1453 mehmed allowed the orthodox church to maintain its autonomy and land in exchange for accepting ottoman authority because of bad relations between the states of western europe and the later byzantine empire the majority of the orthodox population accepted ottoman rule as preferable to venetian rule albanian resistance was a major obstacle to ottoman expansion on the italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th centuries the ottoman empire entered a period of expansion the empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective sultans it also flourished economically due to its control of the major overland trade routes between europe and asia sultan selim i 1512 1520 dramatically expanded the empire s eastern and southern frontiers by defeating shah ismail of safavid persia in the battle of chaldiran selim i established ottoman rule in egypt and created a naval presence on the red sea after this ottoman expansion a competition started between the portuguese empire and the ottoman empire to become the dominant power in the region battle of moh cs in 1526 suleiman the magnificent 1520 1566 captured belgrade in 1521 conquered the southern and central parts of the kingdom of hungary as part of the ottoman hungarian wars and after his historic victory in the battle of moh cs in 1526 he established turkish rule in the territory of present day hungary except the western part and other central european territories he then laid siege to vienna in 1529 but failed to take the city in 1532 he made another attack on vienna but was repulsed in the siege of g ns transylvania wallachia and intermittently moldavia became tributary principalities of the ottoman empire in the east the ottoman turks took baghdad from the persians in 1535 gaining control of mesopotamia and naval access to the persian gulf in 1555 the caucasus became officially partitioned for the first time between the safavids and the ottomans a status quo that would remain until the end of the russo turkish war 1768 74 by this partitioning of the caucasus as signed in the peace of amasya western armenia western kurdistan and western georgia incl western samtskhe fell into ottoman hands while southern dagestan eastern armenia eastern georgia and azerbaijan remained persian barbarossa hayreddin pasha defeats the holy league of charles v under the command of andrea doria at the battle of preveza in 1538 france and the ottoman empire united by mutual opposition to habsburg rule became strong allies the french conquests of nice 1543 and corsica 1553 occurred as a joint venture between the forces of the french king francis i and suleiman and were commanded by the ottoman admirals barbarossa hayreddin pasha and turgut reis a month before the siege of nice france supported the ottomans with an artillery unit during the 1543 ottoman conquest of esztergom in northern hungary after further advances by the turks the habsburg ruler ferdinand officially recognized ottoman ascendancy in hungary in 1547 in 1559 after the first ajuran portuguese war the ottoman empire would later absorb the weakened east african adal sultanate into its domain this expansion furthered ottoman rule in somalia and the horn of africa this also increased its influence in the indian ocean to compete against the portuguese with its close ally the ajuran empire by the end of suleiman s reign the empire spanned approximately 877,888 sq mi 2,273,720 km2 extending over three continents in addition the empire became a dominant naval force controlling much of the mediterranean sea by this time the ottoman empire was a major part of the european political sphere the success of its political and military establishment was compared to the roman empire by the likes of italian scholar francesco sansovino and the french political philosopher jean bodin main article transformation of the ottoman empire further information ottoman decline thesis this article s factual accuracy may be compromised due to out of date information september 2016 the extent of the ottoman empire in 1566 upon the death of suleiman the magnificent ottoman miniature about the szigetv r campaign showing ottoman troops and tatars as avant garde in the second half of the sixteenth century the ottoman empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both europe and the middle east these pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600 placing great strain upon the ottoman system of government the empire underwent a series of transformations of its political and military institutions in response to these challenges enabling it to successfully adapt to the new conditions of the seventeenth century and remain powerful militarily and economically historians of the mid twentieth century once characterized this period as one of stagnation and decline but this view is now rejected by the majority of academics the discovery of new maritime trade routes by western european states allowed them to avoid the ottoman trade monopoly the portuguese discovery of the cape of good hope in 1488 initiated a series of ottoman portuguese naval wars in the indian ocean throughout the 16th century despite the growing european presence in the indian ocean ottoman trade with the east continued to flourish cairo in particular benefitted from the rise of yemeni coffee as a popular consumer commodity as coffeehouses appeared in cities and towns across the empire cairo developed into a major center for its trade contributing to its continued prosperity throughout the seventeenth and much of the eighteenth century under ivan iv 1533 1584 the tsardom of russia expanded into the volga and caspian region at the expense of the tatar khanates in 1571 the crimean khan devlet i giray supported by the ottomans burned moscow the next year the invasion was repeated but repelled at the battle of molodi the crimean khanate continued to invade eastern europe in a series of slave raids and remained a significant power in eastern europe until the end of the 17th century in southern europe a catholic coalition led by philip ii of spain won a victory over the ottoman fleet at the battle of lepanto 1571 it was a startling if mostly symbolic blow to the image of ottoman invincibility an image which the victory of the knights of malta against the ottoman invaders in the 1565 siege of malta had recently set about eroding the battle was far more damaging to the ottoman navy in sapping experienced manpower than the loss of ships which were rapidly replaced the ottoman navy recovered quickly persuading venice to sign a peace treaty in 1573 allowing the ottomans to expand and consolidate their position in north africa battle of lepanto in 1571 by contrast the habsburg frontier had settled somewhat a stalemate caused by a stiffening of the habsburg defences the long war against habsburg austria 1593 1606 created the need for greater numbers of ottoman infantry equipped with firearms resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy this contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps which were never fully solved irregular sharpshooters sekban were also recruited and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the jelali revolts 1590 1610 which engendered widespread anarchy in anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries with the empire s population reaching 30 million people by 1600 the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government in spite of these problems the ottoman state remained strong and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats the only exceptions were campaigns against the safavid dynasty of persia where many of the ottoman eastern provinces were lost some permanently this 1603 1618 war eventually resulted in the treaty of nasuh pasha which ceded the entire caucasus except westernmost georgia back into iranian safavid possession map from 1654 second siege of vienna in 1683 during his brief majority reign murad iv 1623 1640 reasserted central authority and recaptured iraq 1639 from the safavids the resulting treaty of zuhab of that same year decisively parted the caucasus and adjacent regions between the two neighbouring empires as it had already been defined in the 1555 peace of amasya the sultanate of women 1623 1656 was a period in which the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons the most prominent women of this period were k sem sultan and her daughter in law turhan hatice whose political rivalry culminated in k sem s murder in 1651 during the k pr l era 1656 1703 effective control of the empire was exercised by a sequence of grand viziers from the k pr l family the k pr l vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in transylvania the conquest of crete completed in 1669 and expansion into polish southern ukraine with the strongholds of khotyn and kamianets podilskyi and the territory of podolia ceding to ottoman control in 1676 this period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end in 1683 when grand vizier kara mustafa pasha led a huge army to attempt a second ottoman siege of vienna in the great turkish war of 1683 1699 the final assault being fatally delayed the ottoman forces were swept away by allied habsburg german and polish forces spearheaded by the polish king john iii sobieski at the battle of vienna the alliance of the holy league pressed home the advantage of the defeat at vienna culminating in the treaty of karlowitz 26 january 1699 which ended the great turkish war the ottomans surrendered control of significant territories many permanently mustafa ii 1695 1703 led the counterattack of 1695 96 against the habsburgs in hungary but was undone at the disastrous defeat at zenta in modern serbia 11 september 1697 aside from the loss of the banat and the temporary loss of belgrade 1717 39 the ottoman border on the danube and sava remained stable during the eighteenth century russian expansion however presented a large and growing threat accordingly king charles xii of sweden was welcomed as an ally in the ottoman empire following his defeat by the russians at the battle of poltava of 1709 in central ukraine part of the great northern war of 1700 1721 charles xii persuaded the ottoman sultan ahmed iii to declare war on russia which resulted in an ottoman victory in the pruth river campaign of 1710 1711 in moldavia austrian troops led by prince eugene of savoy capture belgrade in 1717 after the austro turkish war of 1716 1718 the treaty of passarowitz confirmed the loss of the banat serbia and little walachia oltenia to austria the treaty also revealed that the ottoman empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in europe the austro russian turkish war 1735 1739 which was ended by the treaty of belgrade in 1739 resulted in the recovery of serbia and oltenia but the empire lost the port of azov north of the crimean peninsula to the russians after this treaty the ottoman empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace as austria and russia were forced to deal with the rise of prussia educational and technological reforms came about including the establishment of higher education institutions such as the istanbul technical university in 1734 an artillery school was established to impart western style artillery methods but the islamic clergy successfully objected under the grounds of theodicy in 1754 the artillery school was reopened on a semi secret basis in 1726 ibrahim muteferrika convinced the grand vizier nev ehirli damat brahim pasha the grand mufti and the clergy on the efficiency of the printing press and muteferrika was later granted by sultan ahmed iii permission to publish non religious books despite opposition from some calligraphers and religious leaders muteferrika s press published its first book in 1729 and by 1743 issued 17 works in 23 volumes each having between 500 and 1,000 copies ottoman troops attempt to halt advancing russians during the siege of ochakov in 1788 in 1768 russian backed ukrainian haidamakas pursuing polish confederates entered balta an ottoman controlled town on the border of bessarabia in ukraine and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground this action provoked the ottoman empire into the russo turkish war of 1768 1774 the treaty of k k kaynarca of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom to worship for the christian citizens of the ottoman controlled provinces of wallachia and moldavia by the late 18th century after a number of defeats in the wars with russia some people in the ottoman empire began to conclude that the reforms of peter the great had given the russians an edge and the ottomans would have to keep up with western technology in order to avoid further defeats selim iii 1789 1807 made the first major attempts to modernize the army but his reforms were hampered by the religious leadership and the janissary corps jealous of their privileges and firmly opposed to change the janissary revolted selim s efforts cost him his throne and his life but were resolved in spectacular and bloody fashion by his successor the dynamic mahmud ii who eliminated the janissary corps in 1826 selim iii receiving dignitaries during an audience at the gate of felicity topkap palace the serbian revolution 1804 1815 marked the beginning of an era of national awakening in the balkans during the eastern question in 1811 the fundamentalist wahhabis of arabia led by the al saud family revolted against the ottomans unable to defeat the wahhabi rebels the sublime porte had mohammad ali the great the vali governor of egypt tasked with retaking arabia which ended with the destruction of the emirate of diriyah in 1818 the suzerainty of serbia as a hereditary monarchy under its own dynasty was acknowledged de jure in 1830 in 1821 the greeks declared war on the sultan a rebellion that originated in moldavia as a diversion was followed by the main revolution in the peloponnese which along with the northern part of the gulf of corinth became the first parts of the ottoman empire to achieve independence in 1829 in 1830 the french invaded algeria which was lost to the empire in 1831 mohammad ali revolted with the aim of making himself sultan and founding a new dynasty and his french trained army under his son ibrahim pasha defeated the ottoman army as it marched on constantinople coming within 200 miles of the capital in desperation the sultan mahmud ii appealed to the empire s traditional archenemy russia for help asking the emperor nicholas i to send an expeditionary force to save him in return for signing the treaty of h nk r skelesi the russians sent the expeditionary force which deterred ibrahim from taking constantinople under the terms of peace of kutahia signed on 5 may 1833 mohammad ali agreed to abandon his claim to the throne in exchange for which he was made the vali of the vilayets provinces of crete aleppo tripoli damascus and sidon the latter four comprising modern syria and lebanon and given the right to collect taxes in adana had it not been for the russian intervention it is almost certain mahumd ii would have been overthrown and mohammad ali would have become the new sultan marking the beginning of a recurring pattern where the sublime porte needed the help of outsiders to save itself the greek war of independence 1821 1829 against the ottomans in 1839 the sublime porte attempted to take back what it lost to the de facto independent vilayet of egypt and suffered a crushing defeat leading to the oriental crisis as mohammad ali was very close to france and the prospect of him as sultan was widely viewed as putting the entire empire into the french sphere of influence as the sublime porte had proved itself incapable of defeating the egyptians britain and austria intervened to defeat egypt by the mid-19th century the ottoman empire was called the sick man by europeans the suzerain states the principality of serbia wallachia moldavia and montenegro moved towards de jure independence during the 1860s and 1870s main article decline of the ottoman empire during the tanzimat period 1839 1876 the government s series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army banking system reforms the decriminalization of homosexuality the replacement of religious law with secular law and guilds with modern factories the ottoman ministry of post was established in istanbul on 23 october 1840 samuel morse received a turkish patent for the telegraph in 1847 which was issued by sultan abd lmecid who personally tested the new invention following this successful test work on the first turkish telegraph line istanbul edirne umnu began on 9 august 1847 the reformist period peaked with the constitution called the kan n u es s the empire s first constitutional era was short lived the parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it romania fighting on the russian side gained independence from the ottoman empire in 1878 after the end of russo turkish war the christian population of the empire owing to their higher educational levels started to pull ahead of the muslim majority leading to much resentment on the part of the latter in 1861 there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for ottoman christians with 140,000 pupils in total a figure that vastly exceeded the number of muslim children in school at the same time who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning arabic and islamic theology stone further suggested that the arabic alphabet which turkish was written in until 1928 was very ill suited to reflect the sounds of the turkish language which is a turkic as opposed to semitic language which imposed a further difficulty on turkish children in turn the higher educational levels of the christians allowed them to play a larger role in the economy with the rise in prominence of groups such as the sursock family indicative of this shift in influence in 1911 of the 654 wholesale companies in istanbul 528 were owned by ethnic greeks in many cases christians and also jews were able to gain protection from european consuls and citizenship meaning they were protected from ottoman law and not subject to the same economic regulations as their muslim comrades the bulgarian martyresses 1877 by konstantin makovsky a russian propaganda painting which depicts the rape of bulgarian women by the bashi bazouks during the april uprising with the purpose of mobilizing public support for the russo turkish war 1877 78 unrestrained by the laws that governed regular soldiers in the ottoman army the bashi bazouks became notorious for preying on civilians the crimean war 1853 1856 was part of a long running contest between the major european powers for influence over territories of the declining ottoman empire the financial burden of the war led the ottoman state to issue foreign loans amounting to 5 million pounds sterling on 4 august 1854 the war caused an exodus of the crimean tatars about 200,000 of whom moved to the ottoman empire in continuing waves of emigration toward the end of the caucasian wars 90 of the circassians were ethnically cleansed and exiled from their homelands in the caucasus and fled to the ottoman empire resulting in the settlement of 500,000 to 700,000 circassians in turkey some circassian organisations give much higher numbers totaling 1 1.5 million deported or killed crimean tartar refugees in the late 19th century played an especially notable role in seeking to modernize ottoman education and in first promoting both pan turkicism and a sense of turkish nationalism in this period the ottoman empire spent only small amounts of public funds on education for example in 1860 61 only 0.2 per cent of the total budget was invested in education as the ottoman state attempted to modernize its infrastructure and army in response to threats from the outside it also opened itself up to a different kind of threat that of creditors indeed as the historian eugene rogan has written the single greatest threat to the independence of the middle east in the nineteenth century was not the armies of europe but its banks the ottoman state which had begun taking on debt with the crimean war was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1875 by 1881 the ottoman empire agreed to have its debt controlled by an institution known as the ottoman public debt administration a council of european men with presidency alternating between france and britain the body controlled swaths of the ottoman economy and used its position to ensure that european capital continued to penetrate the empire often to the detriment of local ottoman interests the ottoman bashi bazouks brutally suppressed the bulgarian uprising of 1876 massacring up to 100,000 people in the process the russo turkish war 1877 78 ended with a decisive victory for russia as a result ottoman holdings in europe declined sharply bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the ottoman empire romania achieved full independence serbia and montenegro finally gained complete independence but with smaller territories in 1878 austria hungary unilaterally occupied the ottoman provinces of bosnia herzegovina and novi pazar in return for british prime minister benjamin disraeli s advocacy for restoring the ottoman territories on the balkan peninsula during the congress of berlin britain assumed the administration of cyprus in 1878 and later sent troops to egypt in 1882 to put down the urabi revolt as the sultan abdul hamid ii was too paranoid to mobilize his own army fearing this would result in a coup d tat effectively gaining control in both territories abdul hamid ii popularly known as abdul hamid the damned on the account of his cruelty and paranoia was so fearful of the threat of a coup that he did not allow his army to conduct war games lest this serve as the cover for a coup but he did see the need for military mobilization in 1883 a german military mission under general baron colmar von der goltz arrived to train the ottoman army leading to the so called goltz generation of german trained officers who were to play a notable role in the politics of the last years of the empire from 1894 to 1896 between 100,000 and 300,000 armenians living throughout the empire were killed in what became known as the hamidian massacres as the ottoman empire gradually shrank in size some 7 9 million muslims from its former territories in the caucasus crimea balkans and the mediterranean islands migrated to anatolia and eastern thrace after the empire lost the first balkan war 1912 13 it lost all its balkan territories except east thrace european turkey this resulted in around 400,000 muslims fleeing with the retreating ottoman armies with many dying from cholera brought by the soldiers and with some 400,000 non muslims fleeing

hope and promise established with the young turk revolution it restored the ottoman constitution of 1876 and brought in multi party politics with a two stage electoral system electoral law under the ottoman parliament the constitution offered hope by freeing the empire s citizens to modernize the state s institutions rejuvenate its strength and enable it to hold its own against outside powers its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place instead this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the empire

ottoman sultanate 17 november 1922 the history of the ottoman empire during world war i began with the ottoman surprise attack on the russian black sea coast on 29 october 1914 following the attack russia and its allies france and britain declared war on the ottomans there were several important ottoman victories in the early years of the war such as the battle of gallipoli and the siege of kut the armenian genocide was the ottoman government s systematic extermination of its armenian subjects an estimated 1.5 million people were killed in 1915 the ottoman government started the extermination of its ethnic armenian population resulting in the death of approximately 1.5 million armenians in the armenian genocide the genocide was carried out during and after world war i and implemented in two phases the wholesale killing of the able bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour followed by the deportation of women children the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the syrian desert driven forward by military escorts the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery rape and systematic massacre large scale massacres were also committed against the empire s greek and assyrian minorities as part of the same campaign of ethnic cleansing the arab revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the ottomans on the middle eastern front where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war the armistice of mudros was signed on 30 october 1918 and set the partition of the ottoman empire under the terms of the treaty of s vres this treaty as designed in the conference of london allowed the sultan to retain his position and title the occupation of constantinople and zmir led to the establishment of a turkish national movement which won the turkish war of independence 1919 22 under the leadership of mustafa kemal later given the surname atat rk the sultanate was abolished on 1 november 1922 and the last sultan mehmed vi reigned 1918 22 left the country on 17 november 1922 the caliphate was abolished on 3 march 1924 main article gaza thesis this section relies largely or entirely on a single source may 2017 several historians such as british historian edward gibbon and the greek historian dimitri kitzikis have argued that after the fall of constantinople the ottoman state took over the machinery of the roman state and that in essence the ottoman empire was a continuation of the eastern roman empire under a thin turkish islamic guise kitzikis called the ottoman state a greek turkish condominium the american historian speros vryonis wrote that the ottoman state was centered on a byzantine balkan base with a veneer of the turkish language and the islamic religion other historians have followed the lead of the austrian historian paul wittek who emphasized the islamic character of the ottoman state seeing the ottoman state as a jihad state dedicated to expanding the world of islam another group of historians led by the turkish historian m fuat koprulu championed the gazi thesis that saw the ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic turkic tribes who had come from east asia to anatolia via central asia and the middle east on a much larger scale and argued that the most important cultural influences on the ottoman state came from persia more recently the american historian heath lowry called the ottoman state a predatory confederacy led in equal parts by turks and greeks converted to islam the british historian norman stone suggested many continuities between the eastern roman and ottoman empires such as the zeugarion tax of byzantium becoming the ottoman resm i ift tax the pronoia land holding system that linked the amount of land one owned with one s ability to raise cavalry becoming the ottoman timar system and the ottoman measurement for land the donum was the same as the byzantine stremma stone also pointed out that despite the fact that sunni islam was the state religion the eastern orthodox church was supported and controlled by the ottoman state and in return to accepting that control became the largest land holder in the ottoman empire despite the similarities stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the timar system were not hereditary at first even after land grants under the timar system became inheritable land ownings in the ottoman empire remained highly insecure and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged timariots from seeking long term development of their land and instead led the timariots to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation which ultimately had deleterious effects on the ottoman economy main article state organisation of the ottoman empire ambassadors at the topkap palace before the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries the state organisation of the ottoman empire was a system with two main dimensions the military administration and the civil administration the sultan was the highest position in the system the civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region s characteristics the state had control over the clergy certain pre islamic turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from islamic iran remained important in ottoman administrative circles according to ottoman understanding the state s primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of orthodox islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty the ottoman empire or as a dynastic institution the house of osman was unprecedented and unequaled in the islamic world for its size and duration in europe only the house of habsburg had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns kings emperors from the same family who ruled for so long and during the same period between the late 13th and early 20th centuries the ottoman dynasty was turkish in origin on eleven occasions the sultan was deposed replaced by another sultan of the ottoman dynasty who were either the former sultan s brother son or nephew because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state there were only two attempts in ottoman history to unseat the ruling ottoman dynasty both failures which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability as such the last ottoman sultan mehmed vi r 1918 1922 was a direct patrilineal male line descendant of the first ottoman sultan osman i d 1323 4 which was unparallelled in both europe e g the male line of the house of habsburg became extinct in 1740 and in the islamic world the primary purpose of the imperial harem was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the ottoman throne and secure the continuation of the direct patrilineal male line descendance of the ottoman sultans b b l the sublime porte the highest position in islam caliphate was claimed by the sultans starting with murad i which was established as ottoman caliphate the ottoman sultan p di h or lord of kings served as the empire s sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government though he did not always exercise complete control the imperial harem was one of the most important powers of the ottoman court it was ruled by the valide sultan on occasion the valide sultan would become involved in state politics for a time the women of the harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the sultanate of women new sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan the strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor the palace schools which would also educate the future administrators of the state were not a single track first the madrasa ottoman turkish was designated for the muslims and educated scholars and state officials according to islamic tradition the financial burden of the medrese was supported by vakifs allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income the second track was a free boarding school for the christians the ender n which recruited 3,000 students annually from christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in rumelia or the balkans a process known as devshirme though the sultan was the supreme monarch the sultan s political and executive authority was delegated the politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as divan the divan in the years when the ottoman state was still a beylik was composed of the elders of the tribe its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites such as religious and political advisors later still beginning in 1320 a grand vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan s responsibilities the grand vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment dismissal and supervision beginning with the late 16th century sultans withdrew from politics and the grand vizier became the de facto head of state yusuf ziya pasha ottoman ambassador to the united states in washington 1913 throughout ottoman history there were many instances in which local governors acted independently and even in opposition to the ruler after the young turk revolution of 1908 the ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy the sultan no longer had executive powers a parliament was formed with representatives chosen from the provinces the representatives formed the imperial government of the ottoman empire this eclectic administration was apparent even in the diplomatic correspondence of the empire which was initially undertaken in the greek language to the west the tughra were calligraphic monograms or signatures of the ottoman sultans of which there were 35 carved on the sultan s seal they bore the names of the sultan and his father the statement and prayer ever victorious was also present in most the earliest belonged to orhan gazi the ornately stylized tughra spawned a branch of ottoman turkish calligraphy main article ottoman law the ottoman legal system accepted the religious law over its subjects at the same time the qanun or kanun a secular legal system co existed with religious law or sharia the ottoman empire was always organized around a system of local jurisprudence legal administration in the ottoman empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local millet the jurisdictional complexity of the ottoman empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups the ottoman system had three court systems one for muslims one for non muslims involving appointed jews and christians ruling over their respective religious communities and the trade court the entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative qanun i e laws a system based upon the turkic yassa and t re which were developed in the pre islamic era an ottoman trial 1877 these court categories were not however wholly exclusive for instance the islamic courts which were the empire s primary courts could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions and jews and christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue the ottoman state tended not to interfere with non muslim religious law systems despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors the islamic sharia law system had been developed from a combination of the qur an the had th or words of the prophet muhammad ijm or consensus of the members of the muslim community qiyas a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents and local customs both systems were taught at the empire s law schools which were in istanbul and bursa an unhappy wife complains to the qadi about her husband s impotence ottoman miniature the ottoman islamic legal system was set up differently from traditional european courts presiding over islamic courts would be a qadi or judge since the closing of the ijtihad or gate of interpretation qadis throughout the ottoman empire focused less on legal precedent and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered however the ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favor in the late 19th century the ottoman legal system saw substantial reform this process of legal modernization began with the edict of g lhane of 1839 these reforms included the fair and public trial s of all accused regardless of religion the creation of a system of separate competences religious and civil and the validation of testimony on non muslims specific land codes 1858 civil codes 1869 1876 and a code of civil procedure also were enacted these reforms were based heavily on french models as indicated by the adoption of a three tiered court system referred to as nizamiye this system was extended to the local magistrate level with the final promulgation of the mecelle a civil code that regulated marriage divorce alimony will and other matters of personal status in an attempt to clarify the division of judicial competences an administrative council laid down that religious matters were to be handled by religious courts and statute matters were to be handled by the nizamiye courts main article military of the ottoman empire ottoman sipahis in battle holding the crescent banner by j zef

black military pilots in history clearly showing military diversification in the ottoman empire the ottoman imperial army in 1900 the first military unit of the ottoman state was an army that was organized by osman i from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western anatolia in the late 13th century the military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the empire the ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief holding the main corps of the ottoman army included janissary sipahi ak nc and mehter n the ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world being one of the first to use muskets and cannons the ottoman turks began using falconets which were short but wide cannons during the siege of constantinople the ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour using bows and short swords on fast turkoman and arabian horses progenitors of the thoroughbred racing horse and often applied tactics similar to those of the mongol empire such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent shaped formation and then making the real attack the ottoman army continued to be an effective fighting force throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries falling behind the empire s european rivals only during a long period of peace from 1740 1768 the modernization of the ottoman empire in the 19th century started with the military in 1826 sultan mahmud ii abolished the janissary corps and established the modern ottoman army he named them as the nizam cedid new order the ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western european countries consequently the young turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education the ottoman navy vastly contributed to the expansion of the empire s territories on the european continent it initiated the conquest of north africa with the addition of algeria and egypt to the ottoman empire in 1517 starting with the loss of greece in 1821 and algeria in 1830 ottoman naval power and control over the empire s distant overseas territories began to decline sultan abd laziz reigned 1861 1876 attempted to reestablish a strong ottoman navy building the largest fleet after those of britain and france the shipyard at barrow england built its first submarine in 1886 for the ottoman empire a german postcard depicting the ottoman navy at the golden horn in the early stages of world war i at top left is a portrait of sultan mehmed v however the collapsing ottoman economy could not sustain the fleet s strength for too long sultan abd lhamid ii distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist midhat pasha and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the russians during the russo turkish war he locked most of the fleet inside the golden horn where the ships decayed for the next 30 years following the young turk revolution in 1908 the committee of union and progress sought to develop a strong ottoman naval force the ottoman navy foundation was established in 1910 to buy new ships through public donations the establishment of ottoman military aviation dates back to between june 1909 and july 1911 the ottoman empire started preparing its first pilots and planes and with the founding of the aviation school tayyare mektebi in ye ilk y on 3 july 1912 the empire began to tutor its own flight officers the founding of the aviation school quickened advancement in the military aviation program increased the number of enlisted persons within it and gave the new pilots an active role in the ottoman army and navy in may 1913 the world s first specialized reconnaissance training program was started by the aviation school and the first separate reconnaissance division was established in june 1914 a new military academy the naval aviation school bahriye tayyare mektebi was founded with the outbreak of world war i the modernization process stopped abruptly the ottoman aviation squadrons fought on many fronts during world war i from galicia in the west to the caucasus in the east and yemen in the south main article administrative divisions of the ottoman empire eyalets in 1795 the ottoman empire was first subdivided into provinces in the sense of fixed territorial units with governors appointed by the sultan in the late 14th century the eyalet also pashalik or beylerbeylik was the territory of office of a beylerbey and was further subdivided in sanjaks the vilayets were introduced with the promulgation of the vilayet law turkish in 1864 as part of the tanzimat reforms unlike the previous eyalet system the 1864 law established a hierarchy of administrative units the vilayet liva sanjak kaza and village council to which the 1871 vilayet law added the nabiye main article economic history of the ottoman empire ottoman government deliberately pursued a policy for the development of bursa edirne and istanbul successive ottoman capitals into major commercial and industrial centres considering that merchants and artisans were indispensable in creating a new metropolis to this end mehmed and his successor bayezid also encouraged and welcomed migration of the jews from different parts of europe who were settled in istanbul and other port cities like salonica in many places in europe jews were suffering persecution at the hands of their christian counterparts such as in spain after the conclusion of reconquista the tolerance displayed by the turks was welcomed by the immigrants a european bronze medal from the period of sultan mehmed the conqueror 1481 the ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the middle east in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler s power and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous the ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact the ottoman economy greatly expanded during the early modern period with particularly high growth rates during first half of the eighteenth century the empire s annual income quadrupled between 1523 and 1748 adjusted for inflation the organization of the treasury and chancery were developed under the ottoman empire more than any other islamic government and until the 17th century they were the leading organization among all their contemporaries this organization developed a scribal bureaucracy known as men of the pen as a distinct group partly highly trained ulama which developed into a professional body the effectiveness of this professional financial body stands behind the success of many great ottoman statesmen the ottoman bank was founded in 1856 in istanbul in august 1896 the bank was captured by members of the armenian revolutionary federation modern ottoman studies indicate that the change in relations between the ottoman turks and central europe was caused by the opening of the new sea routes it is possible to see the decline in the significance of the land routes to the east as western europe opened the ocean routes that bypassed the middle east and mediterranean as parallel to the decline of the ottoman empire itself the anglo ottoman treaty also known as the treaty of balta liman that opened the ottoman markets directly to english and french competitors would be seen as one of the staging posts along this development by developing commercial centres and routes encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions the state performed basic economic functions in the empire but in all this the financial and political interests of the state were dominant within the social and political system they were living in ottoman administrators could not have seen the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in western europe in the early 19th century ottoman egypt had an advanced economy with a per capita income comparable to that of leading western european countries such as france and higher than the overall average income of europe and japan economic historian jean barou estimated that in terms of 1960 dollars egypt in 1800 had a per capita income of 232 1,025 in 1990 dollars in comparison per capita income in terms of 1960 dollars for france in 1800 was 240 1,060 in 1990 dollars for eastern europe in 1800 was 177 782 in 1990 dollars and for japan in 1800 was 180 795 in 1990 dollars economic historian paul bairoch argues that free trade contributed to deindustrialization in the ottoman empire in contrast to the protectionism of china japan and spain the ottoman empire had a liberal trade policy open to foreign imports this has origins in capitulations of the ottoman empire dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with france in 1536 and taken further with capitulations in 1673 and 1740 which lowered duties to 3 for imports and exports the liberal ottoman policies were praised by british economists such as j r mcculloch in his dictionary of commerce 1834 but later criticized by british politicians such as prime minister benjamin disraeli who cited the ottoman empire as an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition in the 1846 corn laws debate there has been free trade in turkey and what has it produced it has destroyed some of the finest manufactures of the world as late as 1812 these manufactures existed but they have been destroyed that was the consequences of competition in turkey and its effects have been as pernicious as the effects of the contrary principle in spain main article demographics of the ottoman empire a population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520 1535 period was obtained by counting the households in ottoman tithe registers and multiplying this number by 5 for unclear reasons the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century an estimate of 7,230,660 for the first census held in 1831 is considered a serious undercount as this census was meant only to register possible conscripts smyrna under ottoman rule in 1900 censuses of ottoman territories only began in the early 19th century figures from 1831 onwards are available as official census results but the censuses did not cover the whole population for example the 1831 census only counted men and did not cover the whole empire for earlier periods estimates of size and distribution of the population are based on observed demographic patterns however it began to rise to reach 25 32 million by 1800 with around 10 million in the european provinces primarily the balkans 11 million in the asiatic provinces and around 3 million in the african provinces population densities were higher in the european provinces double those in anatolia which in turn were triple the population densities of iraq and syria and five times the population density of arabia view of galata karak y and the galata bridge on the golden horn c towards the end of the empire s existence life expectancy was 49 years compared to the mid twenties in serbia at the beginning of the 19th century epidemic diseases and famine caused major disruption and demographic changes in 1785 around one sixth of the egyptian population died from plague and aleppo saw its population reduced by twenty percent in the 18th century six famines hit egypt alone between 1687 and 1731 and the last famine to hit anatolia was four decades later the rise of port cities saw the clustering of populations caused by the development of steamships and railroads urbanization increased from 1700 to 1922 with towns and cities growing improvements in health and sanitation made them more attractive to live and work in port cities like salonica in greece saw its population rise from 55,000 in 1800 to 160,000 in 1912 and zmir which had a population of 150,000 in 1800 grew to 300,000 by 1914 some regions conversely had population falls belgrade saw its population drop from 25,000 to 8,000 mainly due to political strife economic and political migrations made an impact across the empire for example the russian and austria habsburg annexation of the crimean and balkan regions respectively saw large influxes of muslim refugees 200,000 crimean tartars fleeing to dobruja between 1783 and 1913 approximately 5 7 million refugees flooded into the ottoman empire at least 3.8 million of whom were from russia some migrations left indelible marks such as political tension between parts of the empire e g turkey and bulgaria whereas centrifugal effects were noticed in other territories simpler demographics emerging from diverse populations economies were also impacted with the loss of artisans merchants manufacturers and agriculturists since the 19th century a large proportion of muslim peoples from the balkans emigrated to present day turkey these people are called muhacir by the time the ottoman empire came to an end in 1922 half of the urban population of turkey was descended from muslim refugees from russia main article languages of the ottoman empire 1911 ottoman calendar in ottoman turkish arabic greek armenian hebrew french and bulgarian ottoman turkish was the official

and by the majority of muslims of the balkans except in albania and bosnia persian only spoken by the educated arabic spoken mainly in arabia north africa iraq kuwait the levant and parts of the horn of africa and somali throughout the horn of africa in the last two centuries usage of these became limited though and specific persian served mainly as a literary language for the educated while arabic was used for religious rites turkish in its ottoman variation was a language of military and administration since the nascent days of the ottomans the ottoman constitution of 1876 did officially cement the official imperial status of turkish because of a low literacy rate among the public about 2 3 until the early 19th century and just about 15 at the end of the 19th century ordinary people had to hire scribes as special request writers arzuh lcis to be able to communicate with the government the ethnic groups continued to speak within their families and neighborhoods mahalles with their own languages e g jews greeks armenians etc in villages where two or more populations lived together the inhabitants would often speak each other s language in cosmopolitan cities people often spoke their family languages many of those who were not ethnic turks spoke turkish as a second language this section s representation of one or more viewpoints about a controversial issue may be unbalanced or inaccurate november 2010 abd lmecid ii was the last caliph of islam and a member of the ottoman dynasty in the ottoman imperial system even though there existed a hegemonic power of muslim control over the non muslim populations non muslim communities had been granted state recognition and protection in the islamic tradition the officially accepted state d n madh hab of the ottomans was sunni hanafi jurisprudence until the second half of the 15th century the empire had a christian majority under the rule of a muslim minority in the late 19th century the non muslim population of the empire began to fall considerably not only due to secession but also because of migratory movements the proportion of muslims amounted to 60 in the 1820s gradually increasing to 69 in the 1870s and then to 76 in the 1890s by 1914 only 19.1 of the empire s population was non muslim mostly made up of jews and christian greeks assyrians and armenians main articles islam in the ottoman empire ottoman caliphate and ottoman persecution of alevis calligraphic writing on a fritware tile depicting the names of god muhammad and the first caliphs c turkic peoples practiced a variety of shamanism before adopting islam abbasid influence in central asia was ensured through a process that was greatly facilitated by the muslim conquest of transoxiana many of the various turkic tribes including the oghuz turks who were the ancestors of both the seljuks and the ottomans gradually converted to islam and brought the religion with them to anatolia beginning in the 11th century muslim sects regarded as heretical such as the druze ismailis alevis and alawites ranked below jews and christians in 1514 sultan selim i ordered the massacre of 40,000 anatolian alevis qizilbash whom he considered a fifth column for the rival safavid empire selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the ottoman empire into the middle east especially through his conquest of the entire mamluk sultanate of egypt with these conquests selim further solidified the ottoman claim for being an islamic caliphate although ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with murad i reigned 1362 to 1389 the caliphate would remain held by ottoman sultans for the rest of the office s duration which ended with its abolition on 3 march 1924 by the grand national assembly of turkey and the exile of the last caliph abd lmecid ii to france main articles christianity in the ottoman empire and history of the jews in the ottoman empire mehmed the conqueror and patriarch gennadius ii in the ottoman empire in accordance with the muslim dhimmi system christians were guaranteed limited freedoms such as the right to worship they were forbidden to carry weapons or ride on horseback their houses could not overlook those of muslims in addition to various other legal limitations many christians and jews voluntarily converted to secure full status in the society most however continued to practice their old religions without restriction under the millet system non muslim people were considered subjects of the empire but were not subject to the muslim faith or muslim law the orthodox millet for instance was still officially legally subject to justinian s code which had been in effect in the byzantine empire for 900 years also as the largest group of non muslim subjects or zimmi of the islamic ottoman state the orthodox millet was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce and had to pay higher taxes than muslim subjects similar millets were established for the ottoman jewish community who were under the authority of the haham ba or ottoman chief rabbi the armenian orthodox community who were under the authority of a head bishop and a number of other religious communities as well the millet system has been called an example of pre modern religious pluralism main article culture of the ottoman empire depiction of a hookah shop in lebanon ottoman empire the ottomans absorbed some of the traditions art and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires in fields such as architecture cuisine music leisure and government were adopted by the ottoman turks who elaborated them into new forms resulting in a new and distinctively ottoman cultural identity despite newer added amalgamations the ottoman dynasty like their predecessors in the sultanate of rum and the seljuk empire were thoroughly persianised in their culture language habits and customs and therefore the empire has been described as a persianate empire intercultural marriages also played a part in creating the characteristic ottoman elite culture when compared to the turkish folk culture the influence of these new cultures in creating the culture of the ottoman elite was clear yeni cami and emin n bazaar constantinople c slavery was a part of ottoman society with most slaves employed as domestic servants agricultural slavery such as that which was widespread in the americas was relatively rare unlike systems of chattel slavery slaves under islamic law were not regarded as movable property but maintained basic though limited rights this gave them a degree of protection against abuse female slaves were still sold in the empire as late as 1908 during the 19th century the empire came under pressure from western european countries to outlaw the practice policies developed by various sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the slave trade but since slavery did have centuries of religious backing and sanction they never directly abolished the institution outright plague remained a major scourge in ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century between 1701 and 1750 37 larger and smaller plague epidemics were recorded in istanbul and 31 between 1751 and 1801 main article ottoman literature the two primary streams of ottoman written literature are poetry and prose poetry was by far the dominant stream until the 19th century ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction there were no counterparts to for instance the european romance short story or novel analogue genres did exist though in both turkish folk literature and in divan poetry ottoman divan poetry was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form from the persian poetry that largely inspired it it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships both of similitude mura t i naz r ten s b and opposition tez d were more or less prescribed divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge the vast majority of divan poetry was lyric in nature either gazels which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition or kas des there were however other common genres most particularly the mesnev a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry the two most notable examples of this form are the leyli and majnun of fuz l and the h sn a k of eyh g lib ahmet ned m efendi one of the most celebrated ottoman poets until the 19th century ottoman prose did not develop to the extent that contemporary divan poetry did a large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec also transliterated as seci or rhymed prose a type of writing descended from the arabic saj and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a string of words such as a sentence there must be a rhyme nevertheless there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time though exclusively non fictional in nature one apparent exception was muhayyel t fancies by giritli ali aziz efendi a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796 though not published until 1867 the first novel published in the ottoman empire was by an armenian named vartan pasha published in 1851 the novel was entitled the story of akabi turkish akabi hikyayesi and was written in turkish but with armenian script due to historically close ties with france french literature came to constitute the major western influence on ottoman literature throughout the latter half of the 19th century as a result many of the same movements prevalent in france during this period also had their ottoman equivalents in the developing ottoman prose tradition for instance the influence of romanticism can be seen during the tanzimat period and that of the realist and naturalist movements in subsequent periods in the poetic tradition on the other hand it was the influence of the symbolist and parnassian movements that became paramount many of the writers in the tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously for instance the poet nam k kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel ntib h awakening while the journalist brahim inasi is noted for writing in 1860 the first modern turkish play the one act comedy air evlenmesi the poet s marriage an earlier play a farce entitled vak yi i acibe ve hav dis i garibe yi kef ger ahmed the strange events and bizarre occurrences of the cobbler ahmed dates from the beginning of the 19th century but there remains some doubt about its authenticity in a similar vein the novelist ahmed midhat efendi wrote important novels in each of the major movements romanticism hasan mell h y hud s rr inde esr r 1873 hasan the sailor or the mystery within the mystery realism hen z on yedi ya nda 1881 just seventeen years old and naturalism m hed t 1891 observations this diversity was in part due to the tanzimat writers wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of ottoman social structures main article ottoman

period the early or first ottoman architecture period ottoman art was in search of new ideas the growth period of the empire become the classical period of architecture when ottoman art was at its most confident during the years of the stagnation period ottoman architecture moved away from this style however mehmed pa a sokolovi bridge completed in 1577 by mimar sinan the greatest architect of the classical period of ottoman architecture during the tulip era it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of western europe baroque rococo empire and other styles intermingled concepts of ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the mosque the mosque was integral to society city planning and communal life besides the mosque it is also possible to find good examples of ottoman architecture in soup kitchens theological schools hospitals turkish baths and tombs examples of ottoman architecture of the classical period besides istanbul and edirne can also be seen in egypt eritrea tunisia algiers the balkans and romania where mosques bridges fountains and schools were built the art of ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the ottoman empire the greatest of the court artists enriched the ottoman empire with many pluralistic artistic influences such as mixing traditional byzantine art with elements of chinese art ottoman miniature painters the tradition of ottoman miniatures painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums was heavily influenced by the persian art form though it also included elements of the byzantine tradition of illumination and painting a greek academy of painters the nakkashane i rum was established in the topkapi palace in the 15th century while early in the following century a similar persian academy the nakkashane i irani was added ottoman illumination covers non figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in muraqqa or albums as opposed to the figurative images of the ottoman miniature it was a part of the ottoman book arts together with the ottoman miniature taswir calligraphy hat islamic calligraphy bookbinding cilt and paper marbling ebru in the ottoman empire illuminated and illustrated manuscripts were commissioned by the sultan or the administrators of the court in topkapi palace these manuscripts were created by the artists working in nakkashane the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists both religious and non religious books could be illuminated also sheets for albums levha consisted of illuminated calligraphy hat of tughra religious texts verses from poems or proverbs and purely decorative drawings the art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the ottoman empire carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration as it was customary to remove one s shoes in living quarters the weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central asia carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing and eventually spread to the settled societies of anatolia turks used carpets rugs and kilims not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways where they provided additional insulation they were also commonly donated to mosques which often amassed large collections of them ottoman classical music was an important part of the education of the ottoman elite a number of the ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves such as selim iii whose compositions are often still performed today ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of byzantine music armenian music arabic music and persian music compositionally it is organised around rhythmic units called usul which are somewhat similar to meter in western music and melodic units called makam which bear some resemblance to western musical modes the instruments used are a mixture of anatolian and central asian instruments the saz the ba lama the kemence other middle eastern instruments the ud the tanbur the kanun the ney and later in the tradition western instruments the violin and the piano because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the ottoman empire ottoman classical music and folk music in the provinces several different kinds of folk music were created the most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are balkan thracian t rk s north eastern laz t rk s aegean t rk s central anatolian t rk s eastern anatolian t rk s and caucasian t rk s some of the distinctive styles were janissary music roma music belly dance turkish folk music the traditional shadow play called karag z and hacivat was widespread throughout the ottoman empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture it was performed by a single puppet master who voiced all of the characters and accompanied by tambourine def its origins are obscure deriving perhaps from an older egyptian tradition or possibly from an asian source sultan abd laziz was also a music composer miniature from surname i vehbi showing the mehteran the music band of the janissaries the shadow play karag z and hacivat was widespread throughout the ottoman empire main article ottoman cuisine enjoying coffee at the harem turkish women baking bread 1790 ottoman cuisine refers to the cuisine of the capital istanbul and the regional capital cities where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that most of the population regardless of ethnicity shared this diverse cuisine was honed in the imperial palace s kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the empire to create and experiment with different ingredients the creations of the ottoman palace s kitchens filtered to the population for instance through ramadan events and through the cooking at the yal s of the pashas and from there on spread to the rest of the population much of the cuisine of former ottoman territories today is descended from a shared ottoman cuisine especially turkish and including greek balkan armenian and middle eastern cuisines many common dishes in the region descendants of the once common ottoman cuisine include

course of ottoman history the ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures as well as original manuscripts a great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century sultan mehmet ii ordered georgios amiroutzes a greek scholar from trabzon to translate and make available to ottoman educational institutions the geography book of ptolemy another example is ali qushji an astronomer mathematician and physicist originally from samarkand who became a professor in two madrasas and influenced ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students even though he only spent two or three years in istanbul before his death istanbul observatory of taqi ad din in 1577 taqi al din built the istanbul observatory of taqi al din in 1577 where he carried out observations until 1580 he calculated the eccentricity of the sun s orbit and the annual motion of the apogee however the observatory s primary purpose was almost certainly astrological rather than astronomical leading to its destruction in 1580 due to the rise of a clerical faction that opposed its use for that purpose he also experimented with steam power in ottoman egypt in 1551 when he invented a steam jack driven by a rudimentary steam turbine in 1660 the ottoman scholar ibrahim efendi al zigetvari tezkireci translated no l duret s french astronomical work written in 1637 into arabic erafeddin sabuncuo lu was the author of the first surgical atlas and the last major medical encyclopedia from the islamic world though his work was largely based on abu al qasim al zahrawi s al tasrif sabuncuo lu introduced many innovations of his own female surgeons were also illustrated for the first time an example of a watch that measured time in minutes was created by an ottoman watchmaker meshur sheyh dede in 1702 in the early 19th century egypt under muhammad ali began using steam engines for industrial manufacturing with industries such as ironworks textile manufacturing paper mills and hulling mills moving towards steam power economic historian jean batou argues that the necessary economic conditions existed in egypt for the adoption of oil as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century in the 19th century ishak efendi is credited with introducing the then current western scientific ideas and developments to the ottoman and wider muslim world as well as the invention of a suitable turkish and arabic scientific terminology through his

that the ottoman empire was still a formidable military and political power throughout the seventeenth century and that noticeable though limited economic recovery followed the crisis of the years
