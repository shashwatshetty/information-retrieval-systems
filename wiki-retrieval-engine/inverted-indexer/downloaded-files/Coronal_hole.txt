from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search coronal holes are areas where the sun s corona is colder hence darker and has lower density plasma than average because there is lower energy and gas levels coronal holes are part of the sun s corona and are constantly changing and reshaping because the corona is not uniform the sun contains magnetic fields that arch away from areas in the corona that are very thin due to the lower levels of energy and gas which cause coronal holes to appear when they do not fall back thus solar particles escape at a rate great enough to create a lower density and lower temperature in that area contents in the 1960s the sydney chris cross radio telescope took x ray images although it was unclear what they were some research also points out that coronal holes were first spotted in the early 1970s these were found when x ray telescopes in the skylab mission were flown above the earth s atmosphere to reveal the structure of the corona coronal hole size and population correspond with the solar cycle as the sun heads toward solar maximum the coronal holes move closer and closer to the sun s poles during solar maximum the number of coronal holes decreases until the magnetic fields on the sun reverse afterwards new coronal holes appear near the new poles the coronal holes then increase in size and number extending farther from the poles as the sun moves toward solar minimum again there are permanent coronal holes on the north and south poles of the sun coronal hole magnetic field lines image shows what happens when the field lines do not fall back and instead allow solar wind to escape coronal holes generally discharge solar wind at a speed about twice the average the escaping solar wind is known to travel along open magnetic field lines that pass through the coronal hole area since coronal holes are regions in the sun s corona that have much lower densities and temperatures than most of the corona these regions are very thin this thinness contributes to the solar wind since particles within the chromosphere can more easily break through during solar minima coronal holes are the primary sources of space weather disturbances typically geomagnetic and proton storms originating from coronal holes have a gradual commencement over hours and are not as severe as storms caused by coronal mass ejections cmes which usually have a sudden onset due to the fact coronal holes can last for several months it is often possible to predict the recurrence of this type of disturbance significantly farther in advance than for cme related disturbances the solar disk with a coronal hole this visualization shows a coronal hole over the course of 24 hours sampled about once per minute heliophysics list of solar storms gombosi tamas 1998 physics of the space environment new york cambridge university press isbn 0-521-59264 x jiang y chen h shen y yang l li k 2007 january h dimming associated with the eruption of a coronal sigmoid in the quiet sun solar physics 240 1 77 87 v t e the sun internal structure core radiation zone tachocline convection zone atmosphere photosphere supergranulation granule faculae sunspot chromosphere plage spicule moreton wave corona transition region coronal hole coronal loop coronal mass ejection prominence helmet streamer supra arcade downflows variation solar cycle list of solar cycles solar maximum solar minimum wolf number solar wind flare helioseismology heliosphere current sheet termination shock heliosheath heliopause bow shock related topics heliophysics solar activity solar astronomy solar dynamo eclipse solar energy solar neutrino solar observation solar phenomena solar physics solar system solar telescope solar time space weather standard solar model radiation spectral class g2v authority control retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title coronal hole oldid 819547113 categories sunhidden categories wikipedia articles with lccn identifiersarticles containing video clips
