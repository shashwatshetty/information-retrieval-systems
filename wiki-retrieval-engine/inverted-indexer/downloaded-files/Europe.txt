in global affairs between the 16th and 20th centuries european powers controlled at various times the americas most of africa oceania and the majority of asia the age of enlightenment the subsequent french revolution and the napoleonic wars shaped the continent culturally politically and economically from the end of the 17th century till the first half of the 19th century the industrial revolution which began in great britain at the end of the 18th century gave rise to radical economic cultural and social change in western europe and eventually the wider world both world wars took place for the most part in europe contributing to a decline in western european dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the soviet union and the united states took prominence during the cold war europe was divided along the iron curtain between nato in the west and the warsaw pact in the east until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the berlin wall in 1955 the council of europe was formed in strasbourg following a speech by sir winston churchill with the idea of unifying europe to achieve common goals it includes all states except for belarus kazakhstan and vatican city further

between europe and asia countries not geographically in europe but closely associated with the continent the prevalent definition of europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north west and south europe s limits to the far east are usually taken to be the urals the ural river and the caspian sea to the southeast including the caucasus mountains the black sea and the waterways connecting the black sea to the mediterranean sea islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass hence iceland is generally considered to be part of europe while the nearby island of greenland is usually assigned to north america nevertheless there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences cyprus is closest to anatolia or asia minor but is usually considered part of europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the eu malta was considered an island

western shore of the aegean sea as a name for a part of the known world it is first used in the 6th century bc by anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river the modern rioni river in the caucasus a convention still followed by herodotus in the 5th century bc herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts europe asia and libya africa with the nile and the phasis forming their boundaries though he also states that some considered the river don rather than the phasis as the boundary between europe and asia europe s eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer strabo at the river don the book of jubilees described the continents as the lands given by noah to his three sons europe was defined as stretching from the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar separating it from north africa to the don separating it from asia the convention received by the middle ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the roman era used by roman era authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy who took the tanais the modern don river as the boundary the term europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the carolingian renaissance of the 9th century from that time the term designated the sphere of influence of the western church as opposed to both the eastern orthodox churches and to the islamic world a cultural definition of europe as the lands of latin christendom coalesced in the 8th century signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of germanic traditions and christian latin culture defined partly in contrast with byzantium and islam and limited to northern iberia the british isles france christianised western germany the alpine regions and northern and central italy the concept is one of the lasting legacies of the carolingian renaissance europa often figures in the letters of charlemagne s court scholar alcuin further information regions of europe and core europe depiction of europa regina queen europe in 1582 the question of defining a precise eastern boundary of europe arises in the early modern period as the eastern extension of muscovy began to include northern asia throughout the middle ages and into the 18th century the traditional division of the landmass of eurasia into two continents europe and asia followed ptolemy with the boundary following the turkish straits the black sea the kerch strait the sea of azov and the don ancient tanais but maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the don bend at kalach na donu where it is closest to the volga now joined with it by the volga don canal into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers philip johan von strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical don boundary by drawing the line along the volga following the volga north until the samara bend along obshchy syrt the drainage divide between volga and ural and then north along ural mountains this was adopted by the russian empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard but not without criticism by many modern analytical geographers the mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower don and samara well into the 19th century the 1745 atlas published by the russian academy of sciences has the boundary follow the don beyond kalach as far as serafimovich before cutting north towards arkhangelsk while other 18th to 19th century mapmakers such as john cary followed strahlenberg s prescription to the south the kuma manych depression was identified circa 1773 by a german naturalist peter simon pallas as a valley that once upon a time connected the black sea and the caspian sea and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents by the mid-19th century there were three main conventions one following the don the volga don canal and the volga the other following the kuma manych depression to the caspian and then the ural river and the third abandoning the don altogether following the greater caucasus watershed to the caspian the question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s with douglas freshfield advocating the caucasus crest boundary as the best possible citing support from various modern geographers in russia and the soviet union the boundary along the kuma manych depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906 in 1958 the soviet geographical society formally recommended that the boundary between the europe and asia be drawn in textbooks from baydaratskaya bay on the kara sea along the eastern foot of ural mountains then following the ural river until the mugodzhar hills and then the emba river and kuma manych depression thus placing the caucasus entirely in asia and the urals entirely in europe however most geographers in the soviet union favoured the boundary along the caucasus crest and this became the standard convention in the later 20th century although the kuma manych boundary remained in use in

centuries constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes such as the pechenegs and the cuman kipchaks caused a massive migration of slavic populations to the safer heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the rus state to the south and east like many other parts of eurasia these territories were overrun by the mongols the invaders who became known as tatars were mostly turkic speaking peoples under mongol suzerainty they established the state of the golden horde with headquarters in crimea which later adopted islam as a religion and ruled over modern day

inhabited by ethnic germans and in early 1939 the remainder of czechoslovakia was split into the protectorate of bohemia and moravia controlled by germany and the slovak republic at the time britain and france preferred a policy of appeasement bombed and burned out buildings in hamburg 1944 45 with tensions mounting between germany and poland over the future of danzig the germans turned to the soviets and signed the molotov ribbentrop pact which allowed the soviets to invade the baltic states and parts of poland and romania germany invaded poland on 1 september 1939 prompting france and the united kingdom to declare war on germany on 3 september opening the european theatre of world war ii the soviet invasion of poland started on 17 september and poland fell soon thereafter on 24 september the soviet union attacked the baltic countries and later finland the british hoped to land at narvik and send troops to aid finland but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle germany and cut the germans off from scandinavian resources around the same time germany moved troops into denmark the phoney war continued in may 1940 germany attacked france through the low countries france capitulated in june 1940 by august germany began a bombing offensive on britain but failed to convince the britons to give up in 1941 germany invaded the soviet union in the operation barbarossa on 7 december 1941 japan s attack on pearl harbor drew the united states into the conflict as allies of the british empire and other allied forces the big three at the yalta conference in 1945 seated from the left winston churchill franklin d roosevelt and joseph stalin after the staggering battle of stalingrad in 1943 the german offensive in the soviet union turned into a continual fallback the battle of kursk which involved the largest tank battle in history was the last major german offensive on the eastern front in june 1944 british and american forces invaded france in the d day landings opening a new front against germany berlin finally fell in 1945 ending world war ii in europe the war was the largest and most destructive in human history with 60 million dead across the world more than 40 million people in europe had died as a result of world war ii including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during the holocaust the soviet union lost around 27 million people mostly civilians during the war about half of all world war ii casualties by the end of world war ii europe had more than 40 million refugees several post war expulsions in central and eastern europe displaced a total of about 20 million people world war i and especially world war ii diminished the eminence of western europe in world affairs after world war ii the map of europe was redrawn at the yalta conference and divided into two blocs the western countries and the communist eastern bloc separated by what was later called by winston churchill an iron curtain the united states and western europe established the nato alliance and later the soviet union and central europe established the warsaw pact the schuman declaration led to the creation of the european coal and steel community it began the integration process of the european union 9 may 1950 at the french foreign ministry the two new superpowers the united states and the soviet union became locked in a fifty year long cold war centred on nuclear proliferation at the same time decolonisation which had already started after world war i gradually resulted in the independence of most of the european colonies in asia and africa in the 1980s the reforms of mikhail gorbachev and the solidarity movement in poland accelerated the collapse of the eastern bloc and the end of the cold war germany was reunited after the symbolic fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the maps of central and eastern europe were redrawn once more flag of europe adopted by the council of europe in 1955 as the flag for the whole of europe european integration also grew after world war ii the treaty of rome in 1957 established the european economic community between six western european states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market in 1967 the eec european coal and steel community and euratom formed the european community which in 1993 became the european union the eu established a parliament court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency between 2004 and 2013 more central and eastern european countries began joining expanding the eu to its current size of 28 european countries and once more making europe a major economical and political centre of power however in june 2016 the people of the united kingdom in a non binding referendum on eu membership voted to leave the european union main article geography of europe relief map of europe and surrounding regions europe makes up the western fifth of the eurasian landmass it has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent its maritime borders consist of the arctic ocean to the north the atlantic ocean to the west and the mediterranean black and caspian seas to the south land relief in europe shows great variation within relatively small areas the southern regions are more mountainous while moving north the terrain descends from the high alps pyrenees and carpathians through hilly uplands into broad low northern plains which are vast in the east this extended lowland is known as the great european plain and at its heart lies the north german plain an arc of uplands also exists along the north western seaboard which begins in the western parts of the islands of britain and ireland and then continues along the mountainous fjord cut spine of norway this description is simplified sub regions such as the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula contain their own complex features as does mainland central europe itself where the relief contains many plateaus river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend sub regions like iceland britain and ireland are special cases the former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of europe while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off main article climate of europe biomes of europe and surrounding regions europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zones being subjected to prevailing westerlies the climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the gulf stream the gulf stream is nicknamed europe s central heating because it makes europe s climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be the gulf stream not only carries warm water to europe s coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the atlantic ocean therefore the average temperature throughout the year of naples is 16 c 61 f while it is only 12 c 54 f in new york city which is almost on the same latitude berlin germany calgary canada and irkutsk in the asian part of russia lie on around the same latitude january temperatures in berlin average around 8 c 14 f higher than those in calgary and they are almost 22 c 40 f higher than average temperatures in irkutsk similarly northern parts of scotland have a tempertate marine climate the yearly average temperature in city of inverness is 9.05 c 48.29 f however churchill manitoba canada is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of 6.5 c 20.3 f giving it a nearly subarctic climate main articles geology of europe and geological history of europe mount elbrus in russia is the highest mountain in europe the geological history of europe traces back to the formation of the baltic shield fennoscandia and the sarmatian craton both around 2.25 billion years ago followed by the volgo uralia shield the three together leading to the east european craton baltica which became a part of the supercontinent columbia around 1.1 billion years ago baltica and arctica as part of the laurentia block became joined to rodinia later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as baltica around 440 million years ago euramerica was formed from baltica and laurentia a further joining with gondwana then leading to the formation of pangea around 190 million years ago gondwana and laurasia split apart due to the widening of the atlantic ocean finally and very soon afterwards laurasia itself split up again into laurentia north america and the eurasian continent the land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time via greenland leading to interchange of animal species from around 50 million years ago rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of europe and its connections with continents such as asia europe s present shape dates to the late tertiary period about five million years ago europa point as seen from the strait of gibraltar the geology of europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent from the scottish highlands to the rolling plains of hungary europe s most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous southern europe and a vast partially underwater northern plain ranging from ireland in the west to the ural mountains in the east these two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the pyrenees and alps carpathians the northern plains are delimited in the west by the scandinavian mountains and the mountainous parts of the british isles major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the celtic sea the north sea the baltic sea complex and barents sea the northern plain contains the old geological continent of baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the main continent while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents most of the older geology of western europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent avalonia having lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia europe s animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man with the exception of fennoscandia and northern russia few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in europe except for various national parks land use map of europe with arable farmland yellow forest dark green pasture light green and tundra or bogs in the north dark yellow the main natural vegetation cover in europe is mixed forest the conditions for growth are very favourable in the north the gulf stream and north atlantic drift warm the continent southern europe could be described as having a warm but mild climate there are frequent summer droughts in this region mountain ridges also affect the conditions some of these alps pyrenees are oriented east west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior others are oriented south north scandinavian mountains dinarides carpathians apennines and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea forests grow well on this side while on the other side the conditions are much less favourable few corners of mainland europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time and the cutting down of the pre agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems floristic regions of europe and neighbouring areas according to wolfgang frey and rainer l sch probably 80 to 90 percent of europe was once covered by forest it stretched from the mediterranean sea to the arctic ocean though over half of europe s original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest such as the broadleaf and mixed forests taiga of scandinavia and russia mixed rainforests of the caucasus and the cork oak forests in the western mediterranean during recent times deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted however in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest because these grow quicker the plantations now cover vast areas of land but offer poorer habitats for many european forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure the amount of natural forest in western europe is just 2 3 or less in european russia 5 10 the country with the smallest percentage of forested area is iceland 1 while the most forested country is finland 77 in temperate europe mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate the most important species in central and western europe are beech and oak in the north the taiga is a mixed spruce pine birch forest further north within russia and extreme northern scandinavia the taiga gives way to tundra as the arctic is approached in the mediterranean many olive trees have been planted which are very well adapted to its arid climate mediterranean cypress is also widely planted in southern europe the semi arid mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest a narrow east west tongue of eurasian grassland the steppe extends eastwards from ukraine and southern russia and ends in hungary and traverses into taiga to the north main article fauna of europe biogeographic regions of europe and bordering regions glaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of man affected the distribution of european fauna as for the animals in many parts of europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction the woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the neolithic period today wolves carnivores and bears omnivores are endangered once they were found in most parts of europe however deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further by the middle ages the bears habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover today the brown bear lives primarily in the balkan peninsula scandinavia and russia a small number also persist in other countries across europe austria pyrenees etc but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat in addition polar bears may be found on svalbard a norwegian archipelago far north of scandinavia the wolf the second largest predator in europe after the brown bear can be found primarily in central and eastern europe and in the balkans with a handful of packs in pockets of western europe scandinavia spain etc once roaming the great temperate forests of eurasia european bison now live in nature preserves in bia owie a forest on the border between poland and belarus european wild cat foxes especially the red fox jackal and different species of martens hedgehogs different species of reptiles like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes and amphibians different birds owls hawks and other birds of prey important european herbivores are snails larvae fish different birds and mammals like rodents deer and roe deer boars and living in the mountains marmots steinbocks chamois among others a number of insects such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly add to the biodiversity the extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the mediterranean sea creatures are also an important part of european flora and fauna the sea flora is mainly phytoplankton important animals that live in european seas are zooplankton molluscs echinoderms different crustaceans squids and octopuses fish dolphins and whales biodiversity is protected in europe through the council of europe s bern convention which has also been signed by the european community as well as non european

a state of ruin and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s west germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre war levels by the 1950s france also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation later on spain under the leadership of franco also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the spanish miracle the majority of central and eastern european states came under the control of the soviet union and thus were members of the council for mutual economic assistance comecon the states which retained a free market system were given a large amount of aid by the united states under the marshall plan the western states moved to link their economies together providing the basis for the eu and increasing cross border trade this helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies while those states in comecon were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the cold war until 1990 the european community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12 the

further information european folklore and european art europe as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of the roman empire and its culture the boundaries of europe were historically understood as those of christendom or more specifically latin christendom as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of europe especially against islam as in the reconquista and the ottoman wars in europe this shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores roughly divided into slavic latin romance and germanic but with several components not part of either of these group notably greek and celtic cultural contact and mixtures characterise much of european regional cultures kaplan 2014 describes europe as embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances percentage of popular belief in god per european country according to the eurobarometer 2005 main article religion in

themselves christians including catholic eastern orthodox and various protestant denominations among protestants the most popular are historically state supported european denominations such as lutheranism anglicanism and the reformed faith other protestant denominations such as historically significant ones like anabaptists were never supported by any state and thus are not so widespread as well as these newly arriving from the united states such as pentecostalism adventism methodism baptists and various evangelical protestants although methodism and baptists both have european origins

since at least the 4th century and for at least a millennium and a half europe has been nearly equivalent to christian culture even though the religion was inherited from the middle east christian culture was the predominant force in western civilization guiding the course of philosophy art and science the second most popular religion is islam 6 concentrated mainly in the balkans and eastern
