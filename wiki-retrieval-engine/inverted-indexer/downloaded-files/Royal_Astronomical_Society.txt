acceptable to the society as a result of the society s foundation in a time before there were many professional astronomers no formal qualifications are required however around three quarters of fellows are professional astronomers or geophysicists the society acts as the professional body for astronomers and geophysicists in the uk and fellows may apply for the science council s chartered scientist status through the society the fellowship passed 3,000 in 2003 in 2009 an initiative was launched for those with an interest in astronomy and geophysics but without professional qualifications or specialist knowledge in the subject such people may join the friends of the ras which offers popular talks visits and social events see also national astronomy meeting the society organises an extensive programme of meetings the biggest ras meeting each year is the national astronomy meeting a major conference of professional astronomers it is held over 4-5 days each spring or early summer usually at a university campus in the united kingdom hundreds of astronomers attend each year more frequent smaller ordinary meetings feature lectures about research topics in astronomy and geophysics often given by winners of the society s awards they are normally held in burlington house in london on the afternoon of the second friday of each month from october to may the talks are intended to be accessible to a broad audience of astronomers and geophysicists and are free for anyone to attend not just members of the society formal reports of the meetings are published in the observatory magazine specialist discussion meetings are held on the same day as each ordinary meeting these are aimed at professional scientists in a particular research field and allow several speakers to present new results or reviews of scientific fields usually two discussion meetings on different topics one in astronomy and one in geophysics take place simultaneously at different locations within burlington house prior to the day s ordinary meeting they are free for members of the society but charge a small entry fee for non members the ras holds a regular programme of public lectures aimed at a general non specialist audience these are mostly held on tuesdays once a month with the same talk given twice once at lunchtime and once in the early evening the venues have varied

sponsors meetings in other parts of the united kingdom often in collaboration with other scientific societies and universities the royal astronomical society at the university of london history day

only to that of the royal observatory in edinburgh in the uk the ras library is a major resource not just for the society but also the wider community of astronomers geophysicists and historians the
