from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search nearside redirects here for the usage in road vehicles see right and left hand traffic terminology the names of the major seas and some craters on the near side of the moon the near side of the moon is the lunar hemisphere that is permanently turned towards the earth whereas the opposite side is the far side of the moon only one side of the moon is visible from earth because the moon rotates on its axis at the same rate that the moon orbits the earth a situation known as synchronous rotation or tidal locking the moon is directly illuminated by the sun and the cyclically varying viewing conditions cause the lunar phases the unilluminated portions of the moon can sometimes be dimly seen as a result of earthshine which is sunlight reflected off the surface of the earth and onto the moon since the moon s orbit is both somewhat elliptical and inclined to its equatorial plane libration allows up to 59 of the moon s surface to be viewed from earth but only half at any instant from any point the near side as observed over the course of one month showing the libration effects north hemisphere contents the near side of the moon is characterized by large dark areas that were believed to be seas by the astronomers who first mapped them in the 17th century notably giovanni battista riccioli and francesco maria grimaldi although it was found out later that the moon has no seas the term mare plural maria is still used the lighter toned regions are referred to as terrae or more commonly the highlands detailed view by nasa s lro the image of the moon here is drawn as is normally shown on maps that is with north on top and west to the left astronomers usually turn the map over to have south on top as to correspond with the view in most telescopes which also show the image upside down west and east on the moon are where you would expect them when standing on the moon but when we on earth see the moon in the sky then the east west direction is just reversed when specifying coordinates on the moon it should therefore always be mentioned whether geographic or rather selenographic coordinates are used or astronomical coordinates the actual orientation you see the moon in the sky or on the horizon depends on your geographic latitude on earth in the following description a few typical cases will be considered on the north pole if the moon is visible it stands low above the horizon with its north pole up in mid northern latitudes north america europe asia the moon rises in the east with its northeastern limb up mare crisium it reaches its highest point in the south with its north on top and sets in the west with its northwestern limb mare imbrium on top on the equator when the moon rises in the east its n s axis appears horizontal and mare foecunditatis is on top when it sets in the west about 12.5 hours later the axis is still horizontal and oceanus procellarum is the last area to dip below the horizon in between these events the moon reached its highest point in the zenith and then its selenographic directions are lined up with those on earth in mid southern latitudes south america south pacific australia south africa the moon rises in the east with its southeastern limb up mare nectaris it reaches its highest point in the north with its south on top and sets in the west with its southwestern limb mare humorum on top on the south pole the moon behaves as on the north pole but there it appears with its south pole up moon oceanus procellarum ocean of storms ancient rift

hemispheres have distinctly different appearances with the near side covered in multiple large maria latin for seas since the earliest astronomers incorrectly thought that these plains were seas of lunar water the far side has a battered densely cratered appearance with few maria only 1 of the surface of the far side is covered by maria compared to 31.2 on the near side according to research analyzed by nasa s gravity recovery and interior laboratory grail mission the reason for the difference is because the moon s crust is thinner on the near side compared to the far side the dark splotches that make up the large lunar maria are lava filled impact basins that were created by asteroid impacts about four billion years ago though both sides of the moon were bombarded by similarly large impactors the near side hemisphere crust and upper mantle was hotter than that of the far side resulting in the larger impact craters these larger impact craters make up the man in the moon
