the first image taken of the far side of the moon returned by luna 3 as part of human exploration of the moon numerous space missions have been undertaken to study earth s natural satellite of the moon landings luna 2 was the first spacecraft to reach its surface successfully intentionally impacting the moon on 13 september 1959 in 1966 luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a controlled soft landing while luna 10 became the first mission to enter orbit between 1968 and 1972 manned missions to the moon were conducted by the united states as part of the apollo program apollo 8 was the first manned mission to enter orbit in december 1968 and was followed by apollo 10 in may 1969 six missions landed men on the moon beginning with apollo 11 in july 1969 during which neil armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon apollo 13 was intended to land however it was restricted to a flyby due to a malfunction aboard the spacecraft all nine manned missions returned safely to the earth while the united states focused on the manned apollo program the soviet union conducted unmanned missions that deployed rovers and returned samples to the earth three rover missions were launched of which two were successful and eleven sample return flights were attempted with three successes missions to the moon have been conducted by the soviet union united states european space agency japan india and the people s republic of china the moon has also been visited by five spacecraft not dedicated to studying it four spacecraft have flown past it to gain gravity assistance and a radio telescope explorer 49 was placed into selenocentric orbit in order to use the moon to block interference from terrestrial radio sources contents spacecraft launch date carrier rocket operator
