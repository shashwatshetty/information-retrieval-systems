has held a science festival annually in london styled new scientist live which has attracted high profile scientists and science presenters in september 2006 new scientist was criticised by science fiction writer greg egan who wrote that a sensationalist bent and a lack of basic knowledge by its writers was making the magazine s coverage sufficiently unreliable to constitute a real threat to the public understanding of science in particular egan found himself gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy in the magazine s coverage of roger shawyer s electromagnetic drive where new scientist allowed the publication of meaningless double talk designed to bypass a fatal objection to shawyer s proposed space drive namely that it violates the law of conservation of momentum egan urged others to write to new scientist and pressure the magazine to raise its standards instead of squandering the opportunity that the magazine s circulation and prestige provides the editor of new scientist then jeremy webb replied defending the article saying that it is an ideas magazine that means writing about hypotheses as well as theories in january 2009 new scientist ran a cover with the title darwin was wrong the actual story stated that specific details of darwin s evolution theory had been shown incorrectly mainly the shape of phylogenetic trees of interrelated species which should be represented as a web instead of a tree some evolutionary biologists who actively oppose the intelligent design movement thought the cover was both sensationalist and damaging to the scientific community jerry coyne author of the book why evolution is true called for a boycott of the magazine which was supported by evolutionary biologists richard dawkins and p z myers citizen science a first
