observatory greenwich rog known as the old royal observatory from 1957 to 1998 when the working royal greenwich observatory rgo moved from greenwich to herstmonceux is an observatory situated on a hill in greenwich park overlooking the river thames it played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation and is best known as the location of the prime meridian and thereby gave its name to greenwich mean time the rog has the iau observatory code of 000 the first in the list rog the national maritime museum the queen s house and cutty sark are collectively designated royal museums greenwich the observatory was commissioned in 1675 by king charles ii with the foundation stone being laid on 10 august the site was chosen by sir christopher wren at that time the king also created the position of astronomer royal to serve as the director of the observatory and to apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens and the places of the fixed stars so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation he appointed john flamsteed as the first astronomer royal the building was completed in the summer of 1676 the building was often called flamsteed house in reference to its first occupant the scientific work of the observatory was relocated elsewhere in stages in the first half of the 20th century and the greenwich site is now maintained as a museum contents this section does not cite any sources august 2017 learn how and when to remove this template

sussex greenwich observatory latinized as observatorium anglicanum hoc grenovici prope londinum as illustrated in doppelmayr s map of the southern celestial hemisphere ca 1730 there had been significant buildings on this land since the reign of william i greenwich palace on the site of the present day maritime museum was the birthplace of both henry viii and his daughters mary i and elizabeth i the tudors used greenwich castle which stood on the hilltop that the observatory presently occupies as a hunting lodge greenwich castle was reportedly a favourite place for henry viii to house his mistresses so that he could easily travel from the palace to see them laser projected from the observatory marking the prime meridian line laser at night the establishment of a royal observatory was proposed in 1674 by sir jonas moore who in his role as surveyor general at the ordnance office persuaded king charles ii to create the observatory with john flamsteed installed as its director the ordnance office was given responsibility for building the observatory with moore providing the key instruments and equipment for the observatory at his own personal cost flamsteed house the original part of the observatory was designed by sir christopher wren probably assisted by robert hooke and was the first purpose built scientific research facility in britain it was built for a cost of 520 20 over budget out of largely recycled materials on the foundations of duke humphrey s tower the forerunner of greenwich castle which resulted in the alignment being 13 degrees away from true north somewhat to flamsteed s chagrin the original observatory at first housed the scientific instruments to be used by flamsteed in his work on stellar tables and over time also incorporated additional responsibilities such as marking the official time of day and housing her majesty s nautical almanac office moore donated two clocks built by thomas tompion which were installed in the 20 foot high octagon room the principal room of the building they were of unusual design each with a pendulum 13 feet 3.96 metres in length mounted above the clock face giving a period of four seconds and an accuracy then unparalleled of seven seconds per day main article greenwich meridian the 24 hour shepherd gate clock telescope and tree royal observatory greenwich one of the hyper accurate timekeepers at the observatory british astronomers have long used the royal observatory as a basis for measurement four separate meridians have passed through the buildings defined by successive instruments the basis of longitude the meridian that passes through the airy transit circle first used in 1851 was adopted as the world s prime meridian at the international meridian conference on 22 october 1884 voting took place on 13 october subsequently nations across the world used it as their standard for mapping and timekeeping the prime meridian was marked by a brass later replaced by stainless steel strip in the observatory s courtyard once the buildings became a museum in 1960 and since 16 december 1999 has been marked by a powerful green laser shining north across the london night sky since the first triangulation of great britain in the period 1783 1853 ordnance survey maps have been based on an earlier version of the greenwich meridian defined by the transit instrument of james bradley when the airy circle 5.79 m to the east became the reference for the meridian the difference resulting from the change was considered small enough to be neglected when a new triangulation was done between 1936 and 1962 scientists determined that in the ordnance survey system the longitude of the international greenwich meridian was not 0 but 0 00 00.417 about 8 m east besides the change of the reference line imperfections of the surveying system added another discrepancy to the definition of the origin so that the bradley line itself is now 0 00 00.12 east of the ordnance survey zero meridian about 2.3m this old astronomical prime meridian has been replaced by a more precise prime meridian when greenwich was an active observatory geographical coordinates were referred to a local oblate spheroid called a datum known as a geoid whose surface closely matched local mean sea level several datums were in use around the world all using different spheroids because mean sea level undulates by as much as 100 metres worldwide modern geodetic reference systems such as the world geodetic system and the international terrestrial reference frame use a single oblate spheroid fixed to the earth s gravitational centre the shift from several local spheroids to one worldwide spheroid caused all geographical coordinates to shift by many metres sometimes as much as several hundred metres the prime meridian of these modern reference systems is 102.5 metres east of the greenwich astronomical meridian represented by the stainless steel strip which is now 5.31 arcseconds west the modern location of the airy transit is international time from the end of the 19th century until ut1 was based on simon newcomb s equations giving a mean sun about 0.18 seconds behind ut1 the equivalent of 2.7 arcseconds as of 2013 it coincided in 2013 with a meridian halfway between airy s circle and the iers origin main article greenwich mean time greenwich mean time gmt was until 1954 based on celestial observations made at greenwich and later on observations made at other observatories gmt was formally renamed as universal time in 1935 but is still commonly referred to as gmt it is now calculated from observations of extra galactic radio sources to help mariners at the port and others in line of sight of the observatory to synchronise their clocks to gmt astronomer royal john pond installed a very visible time ball that drops precisely at 1 p m 13 00 every day atop the observatory in 1833 initially it was dropped by an operator from 1852 it was released automatically via an electric impulse from the shepherd master clock the ball is still dropped daily at 13 00 gmt in winter bst in summer the observatory underwent an attempted bombing on 15 february 1894 this was possibly the first international terrorist incident in britain the bomb was accidentally detonated while being held by 26 year old french anarchist martial bourdin in greenwich park near the observatory building bourdin died about 30 minutes later it is not known why he chose the observatory or whether the detonation was intended to occur elsewhere novelist joseph conrad used the incident in his novel the secret agent standard lengths on the wall of the royal observatory greenwich london 1 yard 3 feet 2 feet 1 foot 6 inches 1 2 foot and 3 inches the separation of the inside faces of the marks is exact at an ambient temperature of 60 f 16 c and a rod of the correct measure resting on the pins will fit snugly between them during most of the twentieth century the royal greenwich observatory was not at greenwich the last time that all departments were there was 1924 in that year electrification of the railways affected the readings of the magnetic and meteorological departments and the magnetic observatory moved to abinger prior to this the observatory had had to insist that the electric trams in the vicinity could not use an earth return for the traction current after the onset of world war ii in 1939 many departments were temporarily evacuated out of range of german bombers to abinger bradford on avon bristol and bath and activities in greenwich were reduced to the bare minimum on 15 october 1940 during the blitz the courtyard gates were destroyed by a direct bomb hit the wall above the gate clock collapsed and the clock s dial was damaged the damage was repaired after the war after the second world war in 1947 the decision was made to move to herstmonceux castle and 320 adjacent acres 1.3 km 70 km south southeast of greenwich near hailsham in east sussex due to light pollution in london the observatory was officially known as the royal greenwich observatory herstmonceux although the astronomer royal harold spencer jones moved to the castle in 1948 the scientific staff did not move until the observatory buildings were completed in 1957 shortly thereafter other previously dispersed departments were reintegrated at herstmonceux the isaac newton telescope was built at herstmonceux in 1967 but was moved to roque de los muchachos observatory in spain s canary islands in 1979 in 1990 the rgo moved again to cambridge following a decision of the particle physics and astronomy research council it closed in 1998 her majesty s nautical almanac office was transferred to the rutherford appleton laboratory on the harwell science and innovation campus chilton oxfordshire after the closure other work went to the uk astronomy technology centre in edinburgh the castle grounds became the home of the international study centre of queen s university kingston canada and the observatory science centre which is operated by an educational charity science project the queen s house at greenwich showing the royal observatory in the far distance 2017 the observatory buildings at greenwich became a museum of astronomical and navigational tools which is part of the royal museums greenwich notable exhibits include john harrison s sea watch the h4 which received a large reward from the board of longitude and his three earlier marine timekeepers all four are the property of the ministry of defence many additional horological artefacts are displayed documenting the history of precision timekeeping for navigational and astronomical purposes including the mid-20th century russian made f m fedchenko clock the most accurate pendulum clock ever built in multiple copies it also houses the astronomical instruments used to make meridian observations and the 28 inch equatorial grubb refracting telescope of 1893 the largest of its kind in the uk the shepherd clock outside the observatory gate is an early example of an electric slave clock in february 2005 a 16 million redevelopment comprising a new planetarium
