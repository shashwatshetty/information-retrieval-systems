proportional to its thermodynamic temperature in blue is a total energy according to the wien approximation the stefan boltzmann law describes the power radiated from a black body in terms of its temperature specifically the stefan boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths per unit time also known as the black body radiant emittance is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body s thermodynamic temperature t the constant of proportionality called the stefan boltzmann constant derives from other known physical constants the value of the constant is where k is the boltzmann constant h is planck s constant and c is the speed of light in a vacuum the radiance watts per square metre per steradian is given by a body that does not absorb all incident radiation sometimes known as a grey body emits less total energy than a black body and is characterized by an emissivity the radiant emittance has dimensions of energy flux energy per time per area and the si units of measure are joules per second per square metre or equivalently watts per square metre the si unit for absolute temperature t is the kelvin is the emissivity of the grey body if it is a perfect blackbody in the still more general and realistic case the emissivity depends on the wavelength to find the total power radiated from an object multiply by its surface area wavelength and subwavelength scale particles metamaterials and other nanostructures are not subject to ray optical limits and may be designed to exceed the stefan boltzmann law contents the law was deduced by josef stefan 1835 1893 in 1879 on the basis of experimental measurements made by john tyndall and was derived from theoretical considerations using thermodynamics by ludwig boltzmann 1844 1906 in 1884 boltzmann considered a certain ideal heat engine with light as a working matter instead of a gas the law is highly accurate only for ideal black objects the perfect radiators called black bodies it works as a good approximation for most grey bodies stefan published this law in the article ber die beziehung zwischen der w rmestrahlung und der temperatur on the relationship between thermal radiation and temperature in the bulletins from the sessions of the vienna academy of sciences with his law stefan also determined the temperature of the sun s surface he learned from the data of charles soret 1854 1904 that the energy flux density from the sun is 29 times greater than the energy flux density of a certain warmed metal lamella a thin plate a round lamella was placed at such a distance from the measuring device that it would be seen at the same angle as the sun soret estimated the temperature of the lamella to be approximately 1900 c to 2000 c stefan surmised that of the energy flux from the sun is absorbed by the earth s atmosphere so he took for the correct sun s energy flux a value 3 2 times greater than soret s value namely 29 3 2 43.5 precise measurements of atmospheric absorption were not made until 1888 and 1904 the temperature stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones 1950 c and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200 k as 2.574 43.5 it follows from the law that the temperature of the sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella so stefan got a value of 5430 c or 5700 k the modern value is 5778 k this was the first sensible value for the temperature of the sun before this values ranging from as low as 1800 c to as high as 13,000,000 c were claimed the lower value of 1800 c was determined by claude pouillet 1790 1868 in 1838 using the dulong petit law pouillet also took just half the value of the sun s correct energy flux the temperature of stars other than the sun can be approximated using a similar means by treating the emitted energy as a black body radiation so where l is the luminosity is the stefan boltzmann constant r is the stellar radius and t is the effective temperature this same formula can be used to compute the approximate radius of a main sequence star relative to the sun where r is the solar radius l is the solar luminosity and so forth with the stefan boltzmann law astronomers can easily infer the radii of stars the law is also met in the thermodynamics of black holes in so called hawking radiation similarly we can calculate the effective temperature of the earth t by equating the energy received from the sun and the energy radiated by the earth under the black body approximation earth s own production of energy being small enough to be negligible the luminosity of the sun l is given by at earth this energy is passing through a sphere with a radius of a0 the distance between the earth and the sun and the irradiance received power per unit area is given by the earth has a radius of r and therefore has a cross section of the radiant flux i e solar power absorbed by the earth is thus given by because the stefan boltzmann law use a fourth power it has stabilizing effect on the exchange and the flux emitted by earth tends to be equal the flux absorbed close to the steady state where t can then be found where t is the temperature of the sun r the radius of the sun and a0 is the distance between the earth and the sun this gives an effective temperature of 6 c on the surface of the earth assuming that it perfectly absorbs all emission falling on it and has no atmosphere the earth has an albedo of 0.3 meaning that 30 of the solar radiation that hits the planet gets scattered back into space without absorption the effect of albedo on temperature can be approximated by assuming that the energy absorbed is multiplied by 0.7 but that the planet still radiates as a black body the latter by definition of effective temperature which is what we are calculating this approximation reduces the temperature by a factor of 0.71 4 giving 255 k 18 c the above temperature is earth s as seen from space not ground temperature but an average over all emitting bodies of earth from surface to high altitude because of greenhouse effect the earth s actual average surface temperature is about 288 k 15 c which is higher than the 255 k effective temperature and even higher than the 279 k temperature that a black body would have in the above discussion we have assumed that the whole surface of the earth is at one temperature another interesting question is to ask what the temperature of a blackbody surface on the earth would be assuming that it reaches equilibrium with the sunlight falling on it this of course depends on the angle of the sun on the surface and on how much air the sunlight has gone through when the sun is at the zenith and the surface is horizontal the irradiance can be as high as 1120 w m2 the stefan boltzmann law then gives a temperature of or 102 c above the atmosphere the result is even higher 394 k we can think of the earth s surface as trying to reach equilibrium temperature during the day but being cooled by the atmosphere and trying to reach equilibrium with starlight and possibly moonlight at night but being warmed by the atmosphere the fact that the energy density of the box containing radiation is proportional to can be derived using thermodynamics it follows from the maxwell stress tensor of classical electrodynamics that the radiation pressure is related to the internal energy density from the fundamental thermodynamic relation we obtain the following expression after dividing by and fixing the last equality comes from the following maxwell relation from the definition of energy density it follows that where the energy density of radiation only depends on the temperature therefore now the equality after substitution of and for the corresponding expressions can be written as since the partial derivative can be expressed as a relationship between only and if one isolates it on one side of the equality the partial derivative can be replaced by the ordinary derivative after separating the differentials the equality becomes which leads immediately to with as some constant of integration the law can be derived by considering a small flat black body surface radiating out into a half sphere this derivation uses spherical coordinates with as the zenith angle and as the azimuthal angle and the small flat blackbody surface lies on the xy plane where 2 the intensity of the light emitted from the blackbody surface is given by planck s law where is the amount of power per unit surface area per unit solid angle per unit frequency emitted at a frequency by a black body at temperature t is planck s constant is the speed of light and is boltzmann s constant the quantity is the power radiated by a surface of area a through a solid angle d in the frequency range between and d the stefan boltzmann law gives the power emitted per unit area of the emitting body to derive the stefan boltzmann law we must integrate over the half sphere and integrate from 0 to furthermore because black bodies are lambertian i e they obey lambert s cosine law the intensity observed along the sphere will be the actual intensity times the cosine of the zenith angle and in spherical coordinates d sin d d then we plug in for i to do this integral do a substitution which gives the integral on the right is standard and goes by many names it is a particular case of a bose einstein integral or the riemann zeta function or the polylogarithm the value of the integral is giving the result that for a perfect blackbody surface finally this proof started out only considering a small flat surface however any differentiable surface can be approximated by a bunch of small flat surfaces so long as the geometry of the surface does not cause the blackbody to reabsorb its own radiation the total energy radiated is just the sum of the energies radiated by each surface and the total surface area is just the sum of the areas of each surface so this law holds for all convex blackbodies too so long as the surface has the same temperature throughout the law extends to radiation from non convex bodies by using the fact that the convex hull of a black body radiates as though it were itself a black body wien s displacement law rayleigh jeans law radiance zero dimensional models black body sakuma hattori equation stefan j 1879
