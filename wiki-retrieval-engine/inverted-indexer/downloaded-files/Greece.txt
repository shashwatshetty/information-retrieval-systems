and thessalonica while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognize imperial authority outside of these areas a limited amount of slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred although on a much smaller scale than previously thought the byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the greek peninsula came under imperial control again in stages during the 9th century this process was facilitated by a large influx of greeks from sicily and asia minor to the greek peninsula while at the

milieu was the filiki eteria a secret organization formed by merchants in odessa in 1814 appropriating a long standing tradition of orthodox messianic prophecy aspiring to the resurrection of the eastern roman empire and creating the impression they had the backing of tsarist russia they managed amidst a crisis of ottoman trade from 1815 onwards to engage traditional strata of the greek orthodox world in their liberal nationalist cause the filiki eteria planned to launch revolution in the peloponnese the danubian principalities and constantinople the first of these revolts began on 6 march 1821 in the danubian principalities under the leadership of alexandros ypsilantis but it was soon put down by the ottomans the events in the north spurred the greeks of the peloponnese into action and on 17 march 1821 the maniots declared war on the ottomans by the end of the month the peloponnese was in open revolt against the ottomans and by october 1821 the greeks under theodoros

was achieving success against the ottoman navy in the aegean sea and prevented ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea in 1822 and 1824 the turks and egyptians ravaged the islands including chios

revolt in return for territorial gain ibrahim landed in the peloponnese in february 1825 and had immediate success by the end of 1825 most of the peloponnese was under egyptian control and the city of
