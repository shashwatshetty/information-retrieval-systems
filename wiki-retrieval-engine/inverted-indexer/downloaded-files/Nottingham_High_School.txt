mellers after the death of her husband richard partly in his memory but also as an act of atonement for his several wrongdoings against the people of nottingham in order to do this she enlisted the help of sir thomas lovell who was both the governor of nottingham castle and secretary to the treasury as a result of their combined efforts king henry viii sealed the school s foundation deed on the 22 november of that year it is not clear whether this was a new institution or a refoundation or endowment of an existing school of which records exist as far back as 1289 19,940 boys are estimated to have attended the school between 1513 and 2013 1949 saw the granting of the school s coat of arms by the college of arms the full blazon being ermine a lozenge argent charged with three blackbirds rising proper on a chief gules an open book also proper garnished or between two ducal coronets of the last and for the crest on a wreath argent and gules a squirrel sejant gules holding between the paws a ducal coronet or mantling argent and gules motto lauda finem the arms incorporate those of the school s founder the arms of the mellers family were three blackbirds or merles an example of canting arms on a white field dame agnes being a woman would have displayed these on a lozenge rather than a shield in 2007 the school introduced a new logo for more general use a modified version of the shield which omits the lozenge and the ermine field whilst this breaches laws of english heraldry action is rarely taken in such matters the latin inscription on the school arms is lauda finem which translates as praise to the end in the foundation deed mellers provided that a commemoration service should be held in st mary s church in the lace market on the feast of the translation of st richard of chichester namely 16 june each year although the service is now held on the nearest saturday to that date with the exception of the goose fair it is the most ancient ceremonial event still held in the city of nottingham and the oldest which is still largely in its original form the goose fair is now a funfair rather than a livestock fair although there seems to be no record of it being held between the middle of the sixteenth century and its modern revival in 1923 the formal procession is an important part of founder s day and seeks to symbolise the ancient links the school has with the crown the city and the church the foundation deed also provides for the distribution out of a total sum of 20 shillings of certain monies to the lord mayor of nottingham vicar and others and for the purchase of bread cheese and ale for consumption by the officials attending the service any balance remaining is required to be given to the poorest scholar but now is given to a representative
