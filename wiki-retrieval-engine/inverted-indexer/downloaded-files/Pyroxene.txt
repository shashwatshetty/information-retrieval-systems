minerals the pyroxenes commonly abbreviated to px are a group of important rock forming inosilicate minerals found in many igneous and metamorphic rocks pyroxenes have the general formula is xy si al 2o6 where x represents calcium sodium iron 2 and magnesium and more rarely zinc manganese and lithium and y represents ions of smaller size such as chromium aluminium iron 3 magnesium cobalt manganese scandium titanium vanadium and even iron 2 although aluminium substitutes extensively for silicon in silicates such as feldspars and amphiboles the substitution occurs only to a limited extent in most pyroxenes they share a common structure consisting of single chains of silica tetrahedra pyroxenes that crystallize in the monoclinic system are known as clinopyroxenes and those that cystallize in the orthorhombic system are known as orthopyroxenes the name pyroxene is derived from the ancient greek words for fire and stranger pyroxenes were so named because of their presence in volcanic lavas where they are sometimes seen as crystals embedded in volcanic glass it was assumed they were impurities in the glass hence the name fire strangers however they are simply early forming minerals that crystallized before the lava erupted mantle peridotite xenolith from san carlos indian reservation gila co arizona usa the xenolith is dominated by green peridot olivine together with black orthopyroxene and spinel crystals and rare grass green diopside grains the fine grained gray rock in this image is the host basalt unknown scale the upper mantle of earth is composed mainly of olivine and pyroxene pyroxene and feldspar are the major minerals in basalt and gabbro contents figure 2 the nomenclature of the calcium magnesium iron pyroxenes the chain silicate structure of the pyroxenes offers much flexibility in the incorporation of various cations and the names of the pyroxene minerals are primarily defined by their chemical composition pyroxene minerals are named according to the chemical species occupying the x or m2 site the y or m1 site and the tetrahedral t site cations in y m1 site are closely bound to 6 oxygens in octahedral coordination cations in the x m2 site can be coordinated with 6 to 8 oxygen atoms depending on the cation size twenty mineral names are recognised by the international mineralogical association s commission on new minerals and mineral names and 105 previously used names have been discarded morimoto et al 1989 a typical pyroxene has mostly silicon in the tetrahedral site and predominately ions with a charge of 2 in both the x and y sites giving the approximate formula xyt2o6 the names of the common calcium iron magnesium pyroxenes are defined in the pyroxene quadrilateral shown in figure2 the enstatite ferrosilite series mg fe sio3 contain up to 5 mol calcium and exists in three polymorphs orthorhombic orthoenstatite and protoenstatite and monoclinic clinoenstatite and the ferrosilite equivalents increasing the calcium content prevents the formation of the orthorhombic phases and pigeonite mg fe ca mg fe si2o6 only crystallises in the monoclinic system there is not complete solid solution in calcium content and mg fe ca pyroxenes with calcium contents between about 15 and 25 mol are not stable with respect to a pair of exolved crystals this leads to a miscibility gap between pigeonite and augite compositions there is an arbitrary separation between augite and the diopside hedenbergite camgsi2o6 cafesi2o6 solid solution the divide is taken at 45 mol ca as the calcium ion cannot occupy the y site pyroxenes with more than 50 mol calcium are not possible a related mineral wollastonite has the formula of the hypothetical calcium end member but important structural differences mean that it is not grouped with the pyroxenes figure 3 the nomenclature of the sodium pyroxenes magnesium calcium and iron are by no means the only cations that can occupy the x and y sites in the pyroxene structure a second important series of pyroxene minerals are the sodium rich pyroxenes corresponding to nomenclature shown in figure3 the inclusion of sodium which has a charge of 1 into the pyroxene implies the need for a mechanism to make up the missing positive charge in jadeite and aegirine this is added by the inclusion of a 3 cation aluminium and iron iii respectively on the y site sodium pyroxenes with more than 20 mol calcium magnesium or iron ii components are known as omphacite and aegirine augite with 80 or more of these components the pyroxene falls in the quadrilateral shown in figure2 table 1 shows the wide range of other cations that can be accommodated in the pyroxene structure and indicates the sites that they occupy table 1 order of cation occupation in the pyroxenes t si al fe3 y al fe3 ti4 cr v ti3 zr sc zn mg fe2 mn x mg fe2 mn li ca na in assigning ions to sites the basic rule is to work from left to right in this table first assigning all silicon to the t site and then filling the site with the remaining aluminium and finally iron iii extra aluminium or iron can be accommodated in the y site and bulkier ions on the x site not all the resulting mechanisms to achieve charge neutrality follow the sodium example above and there are several alternative schemes coupled substitutions of 1 and 3 ions on the x and y sites respectively for example na and al give the jadeite naalsi2o6 composition coupled substitution of a 1 ion on the x site and a mixture of equal numbers of 2 and 4 ions on the y site this leads to e g nafe2 0.5ti4 0.5si2o6 the tschermak substitution where a 3 ion occupies the y site and a t site leading to e g caalalsio6 in nature more than one substitution may be found in the same mineral first x ray diffraction view of martian soil chemin analysis reveals
