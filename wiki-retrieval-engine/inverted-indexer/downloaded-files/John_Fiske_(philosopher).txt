principal cities of the united states and great britain fiske was elected a member of the american antiquarian society in 1884 the largest part of his life was devoted to the study of history but at an early age inquiries into the nature of human progress led him to a careful study of the doctrine of evolution and it was through the popularization of charles darwin s work that he first became known to the public he applied himself to the philosophical interpretation of darwin s work and produced many books and essays on this subject his philosophy was influenced by herbert spencer s views

flies the evolution kite in america daily graphic september 12 1874 nineteenth century enthusiasm for brain size as a simple measure of human performance championed by scientists including darwin s cousin francis galton and the french neurologist paul broca led fiske to believe in the racial superiority of the anglo saxon race fiske s beliefs on race did not preclude his commitment to abolitionist causes indeed so anti slavery was he that twenty three years after the cessation of the american civil war he declared the north s victory complete despite the feeble wails of unteachable bigots in his book the destiny of man 1884 he devotes a whole chapter to the end of the working of natural selection upon man describing it as a fact of unparalleled grandeur in his view the action of natural selection upon man has been essentially diminished through the operation of social conditions in books such as outlines of cosmic philosophy isbn 0-384-15780-7 fiske aimed to show that in reality there has never been any conflict between religion and science nor is any reconciliation called for where harmony has always existed on page 364 he demonstrates his sensitivity to christianity as a religion we arrive at a deeper reason than has hitherto been disclosed for the difference between our position with reference to christianity and that which has been assumed by radicalism and by positivism it is not merely that we refuse to attack christianity because we recognize its necessary adaptation to a certain stage of culture not yet passed by the average minds of the community it is that we still regard christianity as in the deepest sense our own religion fiske was a popular lecturer on these topics in his early career later he turned to historical writings publishing books such as the discovery of america 1892 in addition he edited with james grant wilson appletons cyclop dia of american biography 1887 he died worn out by overwork at gloucester massachusetts july 4 1901

sentences farther in jensen s preface he stated andrew c mclaughlin an impeccably conservative historian of the constitution who wrote a far better book on the same period said that fiske s book was
