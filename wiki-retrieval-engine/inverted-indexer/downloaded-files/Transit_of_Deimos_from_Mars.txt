deimos across the sun as seen from mars occurs when deimos passes directly between the sun and a point on the surface of mars obscuring a small part of the sun s disc for an observer on mars during a transit deimos can be seen from mars as a small dark spot rapidly moving across the sun s face the event could also be referred to as a partial eclipse of the sun by deimos however since the angular diameter of deimos is only about 1 10 of the angular diameter of the sun as seen from mars it is more natural to refer to it as a transit the angular diameter of deimos is only 2 times the angular diameter of venus as seen from earth during a transit of venus from earth contents a transit of deimos from mars lasts a maximum of about two minutes due to its relatively rapid orbital period of about 30.3 hours because they orbit mars in low inclination equatorial orbits the shadows of phobos or deimos projected onto the surface of mars exhibit a seasonal variation in latitude at any given geographical location on the surface of mars there are two intervals in a martian year when the shadows of phobos or deimos are passing through its latitude during each such interval no or one transit of deimos can be seen by observers at that geographical location compared to about half a dozen transits of phobos the shadow always falls on the winter hemisphere except when it crosses the equator during the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox thus transits of deimos happen during martian autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere roughly symmetrically around the winter solstice close to the equator they happen around the autumnal equinox and the vernal equinox farther from the equator they happen closer to the winter solstice because it orbits relatively close to mars deimos cannot be seen north of 82.7 n or south of 82.7 s such latitudes will obviously not see transits either on 4 march 2004 a transit was photographed by mars rover opportunity while

tables below is generated using jpl horizons there is some discrepancy of a minute or two with the times reported for the series of images above this may be due to imprecision in the ephemeris data used by jpl horizons also the jpl horizons data gives local apparent solar time while the times reported above are probably some form of mean solar time and therefore some of the discrepancy would be due to the martian equivalent of the equation of time note the data below is valid for the original landing sites to the extent that the rovers have moved around on the surface the parameters of the transits as actually observed may be slightly different near misses are in italics transits of deimos from the mars spirit rover landing site duration earth time utc duration local solar time minim
