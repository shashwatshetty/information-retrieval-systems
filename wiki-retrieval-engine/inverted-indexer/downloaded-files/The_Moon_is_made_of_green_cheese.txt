found its way into children s folklore and modern popular culture the phrase green cheese in this proverb simply refers to a young cheese sometimes cream cheese is used though modern people may interpret the color reference literally there was never an actual historical popular belief that the moon is made of green cheese cf the myth of the flat earth it was typically used as an example of extreme credulity a meaning that was clear and commonly understood as early as 1638 contents there exists a family of stories in comparative mythology in diverse countries that concern a simpleton who sees a reflection of the moon and mistakes it for a round cheese the servian tale where the fox leads the wolf to believe the moon reflection in the water is a cheese and the wolf bursts in the attempt to drink up the water to get at the cheese the zulu tale of the hyena that drops the bone to go after the moon reflection in the water the gascon tale of the peasant watering his ass on a moonlight night a cloud obscures the moon and the peasant thinking the ass has drunk the moon kills the beast to recover the moon the turkish tale of the khoja nasru d din who thinks the moon has fallen into the well and gets a rope and chain with which to pull it out in his efforts the rope breaks and he falls back but seeing the moon in the sky praises allah that the moon is safe the scotch tale of the wolf fishing with his tail for the moon reflection g h mcknight this folkloric motif is first recorded in literature during the high middle ages by the french rabbi rashi with a rabbinic parable in his commentary weaving together three biblical quotations given in the main text including one on sour grapes into a reconstruction of some of the talmudic rabbi meir s supposed three hundred fox fables in later works in the tractate sanhedrin a fox once craftily induced a wolf to go and join the jews in their sabbath preparations and share in their festivities on his appearing in their midst the jews fell upon him with sticks and beat him he therefore came back determined to kill the fox but the latter pleaded it is no fault of mine that you were beaten but they have a grudge against your father who once helped them in preparing their banquet and then consumed all the choice bits and was i beaten for the wrong done by my father cried the indignant wolf yes replied the fox the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children s teeth are set on edge however he continued come with me and i will supply you with abundant food he led him to a well which had a beam across it from either end of which hung a rope with a bucket attached the fox entered the upper bucket and descended into the well whilst the lower one was drawn up where are you going asked the wolf the fox pointing to the cheese like reflection of the moon replied here is plenty of meat and cheese get into the other bucket and come down at once the wolf did so and as he descended the fox was drawn up and how am i to get out demanded the wolf ah said the fox the righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wicked cometh in his stead is it not written just balances just weights rashi rashi as the first literary reference may reflect the well known beast fable tradition of french folklore or a more obscure such tradition in jewish folklore see also the tradition in berechiah ha nakdan the near contemporary iraqi rabbi hai gaon also reconstructed this rabbi meir tale sharing some elements of rashi s story but with a lion caught in a trapping pit rather than a wolf in a well however rashi may have actively adapted contemporary french folklore to the t almudic passage as was homiletically practiced in different jewish communities though the tale itself is probably of non jewish european origin rashi s form and elements are likely closer to the original in oral folklore than the somewhat later variation recorded featuring reynard rashi s version already includes the fox the wolf the well and the moon that are seen in later versions petrus alphonsi a spanish jewish convert to christianity popularized this tale in europe in his collection disciplina clericalis the wolf is tempted by the moon s reflection the variation featuring reynard the fox appeared soon after petrus alphonsi in the french classic le roman de renart as renart et ysengrin dans le puits in branch iv the moon cheese element is absent it is replaced by a promise of paradise at the bottom of the well but such a version is alluded to in another part of the collection this was the first reynard tale to be adapted into english as the middle english e vox and e wolf preceding chaucer s the nun s priest s tale and the much later work of william caxton later still the middle scots the fox the wolf and the husbandman does include the moon cheese element la fontaine includes the story in the french classic compilation fables le loup et le renard in book xi the german tale of the wolf and the fox in grimm replaces the well with a well stocked cellar where a newly satiated wolf is trapped and subject to the farmer s revenge being now too overstuffed to escape through the exit wikisource has original text related to this article the original fables of la fontaine the wolf and the fox in the well one of the facets of this morphology is grouped as the wolf dives into the water for reflected cheese type 34 of the aarne thompson classification of folktales where the moon s reflection is mistaken for cheese in the section devoted to tales of the clever fox it can also be grouped as the moon in the well type 1335a in the section devoted to stories about a fool referring to stories where the simpleton believes the moon itself is a tangible object in the water the use of the words the moon is made of green cheese in a passive sentence creates a dilemma of syntax depending upon whether it is considered to be a phrase and its larger context the moon is made of green cheese was one of the most popular proverbs in 16th and 17th century english literature and it was also in use after this time it likely originated in this formulation in 1546 when the proverbs of john heywood claimed the moon is made of a greene cheese a common variation at that time was to make one believe the moon is made of green cheese i e to hoax in french there is the proverb il veut prendre la lune avec les dents he wants to take the moon with his teeth alluded to in rabelais the characterization is also common in stories of gothamites including the moonrakers of wiltshire who were said to have taken advantage of this trope and the assumption of their own naivete to hide their smuggling activities from government officials a 1902 survey of childlore by psychologist g stanley hall in the united states found that though most young children were unsure of the moon s composition that it was made of cheese was the single most common explanation careful inquiry and reminiscence concerning the substance of the moon show that eighteen children of 423 averaging five years thought it made of cheese sometime the mice eat it horseshoe shaped or that it could be fed by throwing cheese up so clouds could catch it or it was green because the man in the moon fed on green grass its spots were mould it was really green but looked yellow because wrapped in yellow cheese cloth it was cheese mixed with wax or with melted lava which might be edible there were many rats mice and skippers there it grew big from a starry speck of light by eating cheese before that time and since the idea of the moon actually being made of cheese has appeared as a humorous conceit in much of children s popular culture with astronomical themes cf the man in the moon and in adult references to it the phrase is the title of a book and appears on at least 21 of its 306 pages a trip to the moon was an early coney island dark ride where after their trip to the moon s surface and its cities samples of green cheese were given out to visitors in john maynard keynes s principal work the general theory of employment interest and money one finds in chapter xvii a section unemployment develops that is to say because people want the

moon the story revolves around the green cheese made by giant spiders which is transported to the moon by leaf cutting ants the myth has spawned an apocryphal recipe for the preparation of moon cheese in mousehunt in the children s educational show the electric company there is a sketch in which fargo north is an astronaut in space who receives orders to proceed to the moon he protests that is

with an expiration or sell by date using doctored pictures purportedly from the hubble telescope at the science writers conference theoretical physicist sean m carroll explained why there was no need to sample the moon to know it s not made of cheese he said the hypothesis is absurd failing against our knowledge of the universe and this is not a proof there is no metaphysical proof like you can proof a statement in logic or math that the moon is not made of green cheese but science nevertheless passes judgments on claims based on how well they fit in with the rest of our theoretical understanding notwithstanding this uncontrovertible argument the harmonic signature of moon rock the seismic velocity at which shockwaves travel is said to be closer to cheese than to any rock on earth early versions of google moon used a swiss cheese pattern for the closest zoom levels before high resolution images became available dennis lindley used the myth to help explain the necessity of cromwell s rule in bayesian probability in other words if a decision maker thinks something cannot be true and interprets this to mean it has zero probability he will never be influenced by any data which is surely absurd so leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese it can be as small as 1 in a million but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with
