introduced in western european languages through the italian tripoli in arabic it is called ar bulus libyan arabic r bl s berber rables from ancient greek tr polis compare sanskrit tri meaning the number 3 and pura meaning a fortress castle city or town hence in sanskrit tripura also means three cities contents see also timeline of tripoli the city was founded in the 7th century bc by the phoenicians who gave it the libyco berber name oea or wy t the phoenicians were probably attracted to the site by its natural harbour flanked on the western shore by the small easily defensible peninsula on which they established their colony the city then passed into the hands of the rulers of cyrenaica a greek colony on the north african shore east of tripoli halfway to egypt although the carthaginians later wrested it from the greeks by the latter half of the 2nd century bc it belonged to the romans who included it in their province of africa and gave it the name of regio syrtica around the beginning of the 3rd century ad it became known as the regio tripolitana meaning region of the three cities namely oea i e modern tripoli sabratha and leptis magna it was probably raised to the rank of a separate province by septimius severus who was a native of leptis magna arch of marcus aurelius in spite of centuries of roman habitation the only visible roman remains apart from scattered columns and capitals usually integrated in later buildings is the arch of marcus aurelius from the 2nd century ad the fact that tripoli has been continuously inhabited unlike e g sabratha and leptis magna has meant that the inhabitants have either quarried material from older buildings destroying them in the process or built on top of them burying them beneath the streets where they remain largely unexcavated there is evidence to suggest that the tripolitania region was in some economic decline during the 5th and 6th centuries in part due to the political unrest spreading across the mediterranean world in the wake of the collapse of the western roman empire as well as pressure from the invading vandals according to al baladhuri tripoli was unlike western north africa taken by the muslims very early after alexandria in the 22nd year of the hijra that is between 30 november 642 and 18 november 643 ad following the conquest tripoli was ruled by dynasties based in cairo egypt first the fatimids and later the mamluks and kairouan in ifriqiya the arab fihrids muhallabids and aghlabid dynasties for some time it was a part of the berber almohad empire and of the hafsids kingdom historic map of tripoli by piri reis in 1510 it was taken by pedro navarro count of oliveto for spain and in 1530 it was assigned together with malta to the knights of st john who had lately been expelled by the ottoman turks from their stronghold on the island of rhodes finding themselves in very hostile territory the knights enhanced the city s walls and other defenses though built on top of a number of older buildings possibly including a roman public bath much of the earliest defensive structures of the tripoli castle or assaraya al hamra i e the red castle are attributed to the knights of st john having previously combated piracy from their base on rhodes the reason that the knights were given charge of the city was to prevent it from relapsing into the nest of barbary pirates it had been prior to the spanish occupation the disruption the pirates caused to the christian shipping lanes in the mediterranean had been one of the main incentives for the spanish conquest of the city tripoli 1675 map by john seller the knights kept the city with some trouble until 1551 when they were compelled to surrender to the ottomans led by muslim turk turgut reis turgut reis served as pasha of tripoli during his rule he adorned and built up the city making it one of the most impressive cities along the north african coast turgut was also buried in tripoli after his death in 1565 his body was taken from malta where he had fallen during the ottoman siege of the island to a tomb in the mosque he had established close to his palace in tripoli the palace has since disappeared supposedly it was situated between the so called ottoman prison and the arch of marcus aurelius but the mosque along with his tomb still stands close to the bab al bahr gate after the capture by the ottoman turks tripoli once again became a base of operation for barbary pirates one of several western attempts to dislodge them again was a royal navy attack under john narborough in 1675 of which a vivid eye witness account has survived dutch ships off tripoli by reinier nooms ca.1650 effective ottoman rule during this period 1551 1711 was often hampered by the local janissary corps intended to function as enforcers of local administration the captain of the janissaries and his cronies were often the de facto rulers in 1711 ahmed karamanli a janissary officer of turkish origin killed the ottoman governor the pasha and established himself as ruler of the tripolitania region by 1714 he had asserted a sort of semi independence from the ottoman sultan heralding in the karamanli dynasty the pashas of tripoli were expected to pay a regular tributary tax to the sultan but were in all other aspects rulers of an independent kingdom this order of things continued under the rule of his descendants accompanied by the brazen piracy and blackmailing until 1835 when the ottoman empire took advantage of an internal struggle and re established its authority the ottoman province vilayet of tripoli including the dependent sanjak of cyrenaica lay along the southern shore of the mediterranean between tunisia in the west and egypt in the east besides the city itself the area included cyrenaica the barca plateau the chain of oases in the aujila depression fezzan and the oases of ghadames and ghat separated by sandy and stony wastelands main articles first barbary war

century the regency at tripoli owing to its piratical practices was twice involved in war with the united states in may 1801 the pasha demanded an increase in the tribute 83,000 which the u s government had been paying since 1796 for the protection of their commerce from piracy under the 1796 treaty with tripoli the demand was refused by third president thomas jefferson and a naval force was sent from the united states to blockade tripoli the first barbary war 1801-1805 dragged on for four years in 1803 tripolitan fighters captured the u s navy heavy frigate philadelphia and took its commander captain william bainbridge and the entire crew as prisoners this was after the philadelphia was run aground when the captain tried to navigate too close to the port of tripoli after several hours aground and tripolitan gun boats firing upon the philadelphia though none ever struck the philadelphia captain bainbridge made the decision to surrender the philadelphia was later turned against the americans and anchored in tripoli harbor as a gun battery while her officers and crew were held prisoners in tripoli the following year u s navy lieutenant stephen decatur led a successful daring nighttime raid to retake and burn the warship rather than see it remain in enemy hands decatur s men set fire to the philadelphia and escaped a notable incident in the war was the expedition undertaken by diplomatic consul william eaton with the objective of replacing the pasha with an elder brother living in exile who had promised to accede to all the wishes of the united states eaton at the head of a mixed force of u s marines american soldiers and sailors along with greek arab and turkish mercenaries numbering approximately 500 marched across the egyptian libyan desert from alexandria egypt and with the aid of three american warships succeeded in capturing derna soon afterward on 3 june 1805 peace was concluded the pasha ended his demands and received 60,000 as ransom for the philadelphia prisoners under the 1805 treaty with tripoli in 1815 in consequence of further outrages and due to the humiliation of the earlier defeat captains bainbridge and stephen decatur at the head of an american squadron again visited tripoli and forced the pasha to comply with the demands of the united states see second barbary war ottoman clock tower in tripoli s old town medina in

intense anti government protests and violent government responses resulting in hundreds killed and wounded the city s green square was the scene of some of the protests the anti gaddafi protests were eventually crushed and tripoli was the site of pro gaddafi rallies the city defenses loyal to gaddafi included the military headquarters at bab al aziziyah where gaddafi s main residence was located and the mitiga international airport at the latter on 13 march ali atiyya a colonel of the libyan air force defected and joined the revolution in late february rebel forces took control of zawiya a city approximately 50 km 31 mi to the west of tripoli thus increasing the threat to pro gaddafi forces in the capital during the subsequent battle of zawiya loyalist forces besieged the city and

jamahiriya political system tripoli comprises local people s congresses where in theory the city s population discuss different matters and elect their own people s committee at present there are 29 local people s congresses in reality the former revolutionary committees severely limited the democratic process by closely supervising committee and congress elections at the branch and district levels of governments tripoli being no exception tripoli is sometimes referred to as the de jure capital of libya because none of the country s ministries are actually located in the capital even the former national general people s congress was held annually in the city of sirte rather than in tripoli as part of a radical decentralization programme undertaken by gaddafi in september 1988 all general people s committee secretariats ministries except those responsible for foreign liaison foreign policy and international relations and information were moved outside tripoli according to diplomatic sources the former secretariat for economy and trade was moved to benghazi the secretariat for health to kufra and the remainder excepting one to sirte muammar gaddafi s birthplace in early
