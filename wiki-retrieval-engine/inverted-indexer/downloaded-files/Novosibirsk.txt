plant specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment additionally a metal processing plant a food processing plant and other industrial enterprises and factories were built as well as a new power station the great soviet famine of 1932-1933 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in novosibirsk they were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city giving rise to slums such as bolshaya nakhalovka malaya nakhalovka and others its rapid growth and industrialization led to novosibirsk being nicknamed the chicago of siberia tram rails were laid down in 1934 by which time the population had reached 287,000 making novosibirsk the largest city in siberia the following year the original bridge over the ob river was replaced by the new kommunalny bridge between 1940 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western russia to novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war and at this time the city became a major supply base for the red army during this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees the rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir now known as the ob sea as a direct result of the station s construction vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area additionally the new open space created by the reservoir s surface caused average wind speeds to double increasing the rate of soil
