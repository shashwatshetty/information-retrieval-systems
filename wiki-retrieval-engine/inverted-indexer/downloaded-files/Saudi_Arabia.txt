hejaz and the indian ocean ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the empire s central authority see also unification of saudi arabia the arabian peninsula in 1914 the emergence of what was to become the saudi royal family known as the al saud began in nejd in central arabia in 1744 when muhammad bin saud founder of the dynasty joined forces with the religious leader muhammad ibn abd al wahhab founder of the wahhabi movement a strict puritanical form of sunni islam this alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to saudi expansion and remains the basis of saudi arabian dynastic rule today the first saudi state established in 1744 in the area around riyadh rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present day territory of saudi arabia sacking karbala in 1802 and capturing mecca in 1803 but was destroyed by 1818 by the ottoman viceroy of egypt mohammed ali pasha a much smaller second saudi state located mainly in nejd was established in 1824 throughout the rest of the 19th century the al saud contested control of the interior of what was to become saudi arabia with another arabian ruling family the al rashid by 1891 the al rashid were victorious and the al saud were driven into exile in kuwait abdul aziz ibn saud the first king of saudi arabia at the beginning of the 20th century the ottoman empire continued to control or have a suzerainty over most of the peninsula subject to this suzerainty arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers with the sharif of mecca having pre eminence and ruling the hejaz in 1902 abdul rahman s son abdul aziz later to be known as ibn saud recaptured control of riyadh bringing the al saud back to nejd ibn saud gained the support of the ikhwan a tribal army inspired by wahhabism and led by faisal al dawish and which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912 with the aid of the ikhwan ibn saud captured al ahsa from the ottomans in 1913 in 1916 with the encouragement and support of britain which was fighting the ottomans in world war i the sharif of mecca hussein bin ali led a pan arab revolt against the ottoman empire to create a united arab state although the arab revolt of 1916 to 1918 failed in its objective the allied victory in world war i resulted in the end of ottoman suzerainty and control in arabia ibn saud avoided involvement in the arab revolt and instead continued his struggle with the al rashid following the latter s final defeat he took the title sultan of nejd in 1921 with the help of the ikhwan the hejaz was conquered in 1924 25 and on 10 january 1926 ibn saud declared himself king of the hejaz a year later he added the title of king of nejd for the next five years he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units after the conquest of the hejaz the ikhwan leadership s objective switched to expansion of the wahhabist realm into the british protectorates of transjordan iraq and kuwait and began raiding those territories this met with ibn saud s opposition as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the british at the same time the ikhwan became disenchanted with ibn saud s domestic policies which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non muslim foreigners in the country as a result they turned against ibn saud and after a two year struggle were defeated in 1929 at the battle of sabilla where their leaders were massacred in 1932 the two kingdoms of the hejaz and nejd were united as the kingdom of saudi arabia main article modern history of saudi arabia saudi arabia political map the kingdom of saudi arabia after unification in 1932 the new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues in 1938 vast reserves of oil were discovered in the al ahsa region along the coast of the persian gulf and full scale development of the oil fields began in 1941 under the us controlled aramco arabian american oil company oil provided saudi arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally cultural life rapidly developed primarily in the hejaz which was the center for newspapers and radio however the large influx of foreign workers in saudi arabia in the oil industry increased the pre existing propensity for xenophobia at the same time the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant by the 1950s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing in 1953 saud of saudi arabia succeeded as the king of saudi arabia on his father s death until 1964 when he was deposed in favor of his half brother faisal of saudi arabia after an intense rivalry fueled by doubts in the royal family over saud s competence in 1972 saudi arabia gained a 20 control in aramco thereby decreasing us control over saudi oil in 1973 saudi arabia led an oil boycott against the western countries that supported israel in the yom kippur war against egypt and syria oil prices quadrupled in 1975 faisal was assassinated by his nephew prince faisal bin musaid and was succeeded by his half brother king khalid saudi arabian administrative regions and roadways map by 1976 saudi arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world khalid s reign saw economic and social development progress at an extremely rapid rate transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country in foreign policy close ties with the us were developed in 1979 two events occurred which greatly concerned the government and had a long term influence on saudi foreign and domestic policy the first was the iranian islamic revolution it was feared that the country s shi ite minority in the eastern province which is also the location of the oil fields might rebel under the influence of their iranian co religionists there were several anti government uprisings in the region such as the 1979 qatif uprising the second event was the grand mosque seizure in mecca by islamist extremists the militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un islamic nature of the saudi government the government regained control of the mosque after 10 days and those captured were executed part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country for example the closure of cinemas and to give the ulema a greater role in government neither entirely succeeded as islamism continued to grow in strength dammam no 7 the first commercial oil well in saudi arabia struck oil on 4 march 1938 in 1980 saudi arabia bought out the american interests in aramco king khalid died of a heart attack in june 1982 he was succeeded by his brother king fahd who added the title custodian of the two holy mosques to his name in 1986 in response to considerable fundamentalist pressure to avoid use of majesty in association with anything except god fahd continued to develop close relations with the united states and increased the purchase of american and british military equipment the vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on saudi society it led to rapid technological but not cultural modernisation urbanization mass public education and the creation of new media this and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional saudi norms and values although there was dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many saudis who began to look for wider participation in government in the 1980s saudi arabia spent 25 billion in support of saddam hussein in the iran iraq war however saudi arabia condemned the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 1990 and asked the us to intervene king fahd allowed american and coalition troops to be stationed in saudi arabia he invited the kuwaiti government and many of its citizens to stay in saudi arabia but expelled citizens of yemen and jordan because of their governments support of iraq in 1991 saudi arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate kuwait saudi arabia s relations with the west began to cause growing concern among some of the ulema and students of sharia law and was one of the issues that led to an increase in islamist terrorism in saudi arabia as well as islamist terrorist attacks in western countries by saudi nationals osama bin laden was a saudi national until stripped of his nationality in 1994 and was responsible for the 1998 u s embassy bombings in east africa and the 2000 uss cole bombing near the port of aden yemen 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in september 11 attacks in new york city washington d c and near shanksville pennsylvania were saudi nationals many saudis who did not support the islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government s policies oil and gas pipelines in the middle east islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government although now extremely wealthy saudi arabia s economy was near stagnant high taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent and has been reflected in a rise in civil unrest and discontent with the royal family in response a number of limited reforms were initiated by king fahd in march 1992 he introduced the basic law which emphasised the duties and responsibilities of a ruler in december 1993 the consultative council was inaugurated it is composed of a chairman and 60 members all chosen by the king the king s intent was to respond to dissent while making as few actual changes in the status quo as possible fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind a system based on elections is not consistent with our islamic creed which approves of government by consultation sh r in 1995 fahd suffered a debilitating stroke and the crown prince abdullah assumed the role of de facto regent taking on the day to day running of the country however his authority was hindered by conflict with fahd s full brothers known with fahd as the sudairi seven from the 1990s signs of discontent continued and included in 2003 and 2004 a series of bombings and armed violence in riyadh jeddah yanbu and khobar in february april 2005 the first ever nationwide municipal elections were held in saudi arabia women were not allowed to take part in the poll in 2005 king fahd died and was succeeded by abdullah who continued the policy of minimum reform and clamping down on protests the king introduced a number of economic reforms aimed at reducing the country s reliance on oil revenue limited deregulation encouragement of foreign investment and privatization in february 2009 abdullah announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary armed forces and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees in the judiciary and the mutaween religious police with more moderate individuals and the appointment of the country s first female deputy minister on 29 january 2011 hundreds of protesters gathered in the city of jeddah in a rare display of criticism against the city s poor infrastructure after deadly floods swept through the city killing eleven people police stopped the demonstration after about 15 minutes and arrested 30 to 50 people since 2011 saudi arabia has been affected by its own arab spring protests in response king abdullah announced on 22 february 2011 a series of benefits for citizens amounting to 36 billion of which 10.7 billion was earmarked for housing no political reforms were announced as part of the package though some prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned on 18 march the same year king abdullah announced a package of 93 billion which included 500,000 new homes to a cost of 67 billion in addition to creating 60,000 new security jobs although male only municipal elections were held on 29 september 2011 abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the 2015 municipal elections and also to be nominated to the shura council main article politics of saudi arabia salman al saud king and prime minister mohammad bin salman crown prince saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy however according to the basic law of saudi arabia adopted by royal decree in 1992 the king must comply with sharia islamic law and the quran while the quran and the sunnah the traditions of muhammad are declared to be the country s constitution no political parties or national elections are permitted critics regard it as a authoritarian dictatorship the economist rates the saudi government as the fifth most authoritarian government out of 167 rated in its 2012 democracy index and freedom house gives it its lowest not free rating 7.0 1 best 7 worst for 2013 in the absence of national elections and political parties politics in saudi arabia takes place in two distinct arenas within the royal family the al saud and between the royal family and the rest of saudi society outside of the al saud participation in the political process is limited to a relatively small segment of the population and takes the form of the royal family consulting with the ulema tribal sheikhs and members of important commercial families on major decisions this process is not reported by the saudi media by custom all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis in many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule tribal identity remains strong and outside of the royal family political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events as mentioned earlier in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the consultative council in the early 1990s and the national dialogue forum in 2003 the rule of the al saud faces political opposition from four sources sunni islamist activism liberal critics the shi ite minority particularly in the eastern province and long standing tribal and regionalist particularistic opponents for example in the hejaz of these the islamic activists have been the most prominent threat to the government and have in recent years perpetrated a number of violent or terrorist acts in the country however open protest against the government even if peaceful is not tolerated saudi arabia is the only country in the world that effectively bans women from driving although there is no written law to that effect in practice women are hindered from obtaining the locally issued licenses required to drive however on 26 september 2017 king salman decreed that women will be allowed to gain driver s licenses in the kingdom effectively granting women the right to drive on 25 september 2011 saudi arabia s king abdullah announced that women will have the right to stand and vote in future local elections and join the advisory shura council as full members the king combines legislative executive and judicial functions and royal decrees form the basis of the country s legislation the king is also the prime minister and presides over the council of ministers of saudi arabia and consultative assembly of saudi arabia the royal family dominates the political system the family s vast numbers allow it to control most of the kingdom s important posts and to have an involvement and presence at all levels of government the number of princes is estimated to be at least 7,000 with most power and influence being wielded by the 200 or so male descendants of ibn saud the key ministries are generally reserved for the royal family as are the thirteen regional governorships long term political and government appointments have resulted in the creation of power fiefdoms for senior princes such as those of king abdullah who had been commander of the national guard since 1963 until 2010 when he appointed his son to replace him former crown prince sultan minister of defence and aviation from 1962 to his death in 2011 former crown prince prince nayef who was the minister of interior from 1975 to his death in 2012 prince saud who had been minister of foreign affairs since 1975 and current king salman who was minister of defense and aviation before he was crown prince and governor of the riyadh province from 1962 to 2011 the current minister of defense is prince mohammad bin salman the son of king salman and crown prince the royal family is politically divided by factions based on clan loyalties personal ambitions and ideological differences the most powerful clan faction is known as the sudairi seven comprising the late king fahd and his full brothers and their descendants ideological divisions include issues over the speed and direction of reform and whether the role of the ulema should be increased or reduced there were divisions within the family over who should succeed to the throne after the accession or earlier death of prince sultan when prince sultan died before ascending to the throne on 21 october 2011 king abdullah appointed prince nayef as crown prince the following year prince nayef also died before ascending to the throne as many as 500 princes government ministers and business people including prince fahd bin abdullah were arrested by saudi arabian authorities as part of an anti corruption purge in november 2017 the saudi government and the royal family have often over many years been accused of corruption in a country that is said to belong to the royal family and is named for them the lines between state assets and the personal wealth of senior princes are blurred the extent of corruption has been described as systemic and endemic and its existence was acknowledged and defended by prince bandar bin sultan a senior member of the royal family in an interview in 2001 although corruption allegations have often been limited to broad undocumented accusations specific allegations were made in 2007 when it was claimed that the british defence contractor bae systems had paid prince bandar us 2 billion in bribes relating to the al yamamah arms deal prince bandar denied the allegations investigations by both us and uk authorities resulted in 2010 in plea bargain agreements with the company by which it paid 447 million in fines but did not admit to bribery transparency international in its annual corruption perceptions index for 2010 gave saudi arabia a score of 4.7 on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is highly corrupt and 10 is highly clean saudi arabia has undergone a process of political and social reform such as to increase public transparency and good governance however nepotism and patronage are widespread when doing business in the country the enforcement of the anti corruption laws is selective and public officials engage in corruption with impunity a number of prominent saudi arabian princes government ministers and businesspeople including prince al waleed bin talal were arrested in saudi arabia in november 2017 there has been mounting pressure to reform and modernize the royal family s rule an agenda championed by king abdullah both before and after his accession in 2005 the creation of the consultative council in the early 1990s did not satisfy demands for political participation and in 2003 an annual national dialogue forum was announced that would allow selected professionals and intellectuals to publicly debate current national issues within certain prescribed parameters in 2005 the first municipal elections were held in 2007 the allegiance council was created to regulate the succession in 2009 the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post however the changes have been criticized as being too slow or merely cosmetic abdullah ibn muhammad al ash sheikh with bogdan borusewicz in the polish senate 26 may 2014 saudi arabia is almost unique in giving the ulema the body of islamic religious leaders and jurists a direct role in government the preferred ulema are of the salafi persuasion the ulema have also been a key influence in major government decisions for example the imposition of the oil embargo in 1973 and the invitation to foreign troops to saudi arabia in 1990 in addition they have had a major role in the judicial and education systems and a monopoly of authority in the sphere of religious and social morals by the 1970s as a result of oil wealth and the modernization of the country initiated by king faisal important changes to saudi society were under way and the power of the ulema was in decline however this changed following the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca in 1979 by islamist radicals the government s response to the crisis included strengthening the ulema s powers and increasing their financial support in particular they were given greater control over the education system and allowed to enforce stricter observance of wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour after his accession to the throne in 2005 king abdullah took steps to reduce the powers of the ulema for instance transferring control over girls education to the ministry of education the ulema have historically been led by the al ash sheikh the country s leading religious family the al ash sheikh are the descendants of muhammad ibn abd al wahhab the 18th century founder of the wahhabi form of sunni islam which is today dominant in saudi arabia the family is second in prestige only to the al saud the royal family with whom they formed a mutual support pact and power sharing arrangement nearly 300 years ago the pact which persists to this day is based on the al saud maintaining the al ash sheikh s authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating wahhabi doctrine in return the al ash sheikh support the al saud s political authority thereby using its religious moral authority to legitimize the royal family s rule although the al ash sheikh s domination of the ulema has diminished in recent decades they still hold the most important religious posts and are closely linked to the al saud by a high degree of intermarriage main article legal system of saudi arabia see also capital punishment in saudi arabia and public executions in saudi arabia verses from the quran the quran is the official constitution of the country and a primary source of law saudi arabia is unique in enshrining a religious text as a political document the primary source of law is the islamic sharia derived from the teachings of the qur an and the sunnah the traditions of the prophet saudi arabia is unique among modern muslim states in that sharia is not codified and there is no system of judicial precedent giving judges the power to use independent legal reasoning to make a decision saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the hanbali school of jurisprudence or fiqh found in pre modern texts and noted for its literalist interpretation of the qur an and hadith because the judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments either his own or of other judges and may apply his personal interpretation of sharia to any particular case divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases making predictability of legal interpretation difficult the sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of saudi arabia and its judges qadi and lawyers form part of the ulema the country s islamic scholars royal decrees are the other main source of law but are referred to as regulations rather than laws because they are subordinate to the sharia royal decrees supplement sharia in areas such as labor commercial and corporate law additionally traditional tribal law and custom remain significant extra sharia government tribunals usually handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees final appeal from both sharia courts and government tribunals is to the king and all courts and tribunals follow sharia rules of evidence and procedure the saudi system of justice has been criticized for its ultra puritanical judges who are often harsh in their sentencing with beheading for the crime of witchcraft but also sometimes overly lenient for cases of rape or wife beating and slow for example leaving thousands of abandoned women unable to secure a divorce the
