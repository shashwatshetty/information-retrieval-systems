drives a 3 inch floppy disk removed from its housing a floppy disk also called a floppy diskette or just disk is a type of disk storage composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium sealed in a rectangular plastic enclosure lined with fabric that removes dust particles floppy disks are read and written by a floppy disk drive fdd floppy disks initially as 8 inch 200 mm media and later in 5 inch 133 mm and 3 inch 90 mm sizes were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s into the first years of the 21st century by 2006 computers were rarely manufactured with installed floppy disk drives 3 inch floppy disks can be used with an external usb floppy disk drive but usb drives for 5 inch 8 inch and non standard diskettes are rare to non existent these formats are usually handled by older equipment while floppy disk drives still have some limited uses especially with legacy industrial computer equipment they have been superseded by data storage

disk 1971 v t e the first commercial floppy disks developed in the late 1960s were 8 inches 200 mm in diameter they became commercially available in 1971 as a component of ibm products and then were sold separately beginning in 1972 by memorex and others these disks and associated drives were produced and improved upon by ibm and other companies such as memorex shugart associates and burroughs corporation the term floppy disk appeared in print as early as 1970 and although in 1973 ibm announced its first media as the type 1 diskette the industry continued to use the terms floppy disk or floppy in 1976 shugart associates introduced the first 5 inch fdd by 1978 there were more than 10 manufacturers producing such fdds there were competing floppy disk formats with hard and soft sector versions and encoding schemes such as fm mfm m fm and gcr the 5 inch format displaced the 8 inch one for most applications and the hard sectored disk format disappeared the most common capacity of the 5 inch format in dos based pcs was 360 kb in 1984 ibm introduced with its pc at model the 1.2 mb dual sided floppy disk but it never became very popular ibm started using the 720 kb double density 3 inch microfloppy disk on its convertible laptop computer in 1986 and the 1.44 mb high density version with the ps 2 line in 1987 these disk drives could be added to older pc models in 1988 ibm introduced a drive for 2.88 mb dsed diskettes in its top of the line ps 2 models but this was a commercial failure throughout the early 1980s limitations of the 5 inch format became clear originally designed to be more practical than the 8 inch format it was itself too large as the quality of recording media grew data could be stored in a smaller area a number of solutions were developed with drives at 2 2 3 3 3 and 4 inches and sony s 90.0 mm 94.0 mm disk offered by various companies they all shared a number of advantages over the old format including a rigid case with a sliding metal cover over the head slot which helped protect the delicate magnetic medium from dust and damage and a sliding write protection tab which was far more practical than the adhesive tabs used with earlier disks the large market share of the 5 inch format made it difficult for these new formats to gain significant market share a variant on the sony design introduced in 1982 by a large number of manufacturers was then rapidly adopted by 1988 the 3 inch was outselling the 5 inch generally the term floppy disk persisted even though later model floppy disks had a hard case around an internal floppy disk by the end of the 1980s 5 inch disks had been superseded by 3 inch disks during this time pcs frequently came equipped with drives of both sizes by the mid-1990s 5 inch drives had virtually disappeared as the 3 inch disk became the predominant floppy disk the advantages of the 3 inch disk were its higher capacity its smaller size and its rigid case which provided better protection from dirt and other environmental risks however largely due to its simpler construction with no metal parts the 5 inch disk unit price was lower throughout its history usually in the range of a third to a half that of a 3 inch disk imation usb floppy drive model 01946 an external drive that accepts high density disks floppy disks became ubiquitous during the 1980s and 1990s in their use with personal computers to distribute software transfer data and create backups before hard disks became affordable to the general population floppy disks were often used to store a computer s operating system os most home computers from that period have an elementary os and basic stored in rom with the option of loading a more advanced operating system from a floppy disk by the early 1990s the increasing software size meant large packages like windows or adobe photoshop required a dozen disks or more in 1996 there were an estimated five billion standard floppy disks in use then distribution of larger packages was gradually replaced by cd roms dvds and online distribution an attempt to enhance the existing 3 inch designs was the superdisk in the late 1990s utilizing very narrow data tracks and a high precision head guidance mechanism with a capacity of 120 mb and backward compatibility with standard 3 inch floppies a format war briefly occurred between superdisk and other high density floppy disk products although ultimately recordable cds dvds solid state flash storage and eventually online storage would render all these removable disk formats obsolete external usb based floppy disk drives are still available and many modern systems provide firmware support for booting from such drives front and rear of a retail 3.5 inch and 5.25 inch floppy disk cleaning kit as sold in australia at retailer big w circa early 1990s in the mid 1990s mechanically incompatible higher density floppy disks were introduced like the iomega zip disk adoption was limited by the competition between proprietary formats and the need to buy expensive drives for computers where the disks would be used in some cases failure in market penetration was exacerbated by release of higher capacity versions of the drive and media being not backward compatible with the original drives dividing the users between new and old adopters consumers were wary of making costly investments into unproven and rapidly changing technologies so none of the technologies became the established standard little used floppy disk drives sitting unused for years in computers can actually damage disks due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings this pulls dust into the mechanism which coats all surfaces including the exposed read write head upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism and the dust on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters leading to nearly instant fouling of the media the dust also gets into the drive mechanism lubricant turning it into a sticky slime which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement this causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations some users incorrectly assume that this means all their disks have gone bad when it is in fact the drive that is the problem the solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period apple introduced the imac in 1998 with a cd rom drive but no floppy drive this made usb connected floppy drives popular accessories as the imac came without any writable removable media device recordable cds with even greater capacity compatible with existing infrastructure of cd rom drives made the expensive new high capacity floppy technologies obsolete the floppy disk s remaining reusability advantage was then eliminated by re writeable cds however writing and rewriting cds was never as fast or convenient as writing on floppy disks when the data fits on one or two floppy disks networking advancements in flash based devices and widespread adoption of usb provided another alternative that in turn made both floppy disks and optical storage obsolete for some purposes the rise of file sharing and multi megapixel digital photography encouraged the use of files larger than most 3 inch disks the largest capacity standard disks could hold floppy disks were commonly used as sneakernet carriers for file transfer but the broad availability of lans and fast internet connections provided a simpler and faster method of transferring such files where the air gapping of a sneakernet is not an important benefit other removable storage devices have advantages in both capacity and performance when network connections are unavailable or when networks are inadequate different data storage media a floppy hardware emulator same size as a 3 inch drive provides a usb interface to the user nonetheless as of 2002 most manufacturers still provided floppy disk drives as standard equipment to meet user demand for file transfer and an emergency boot device as well as for the general secure feeling of having the familiar device by this time the retail cost of a floppy drive had fallen to around 20 so there was little financial incentive to omit the device from a system subsequently enabled by the widespread support for usb flash drives and bios boot manufacturers and retailers progressively reduced the availability of floppy disk drives as standard equipment in february 2003 dell a leading computer company at the time announced that floppy drives would no longer be pre installed on dell dimension home computers although they were still available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket oem add on as of january 2007 only 2 of computers sold in stores contained built in floppy disk drives floppy disks are used for emergency boots in aging systems lacking support for other bootable media and for bios updates since most bios and firmware programs can still be executed from bootable floppy disks if bios updates fail or become corrupt floppy drives can sometimes be used to perform a recovery the music and theatre industries still use equipment requiring standard floppy disks e g synthesizers samplers drum machines sequencers and lighting consoles industrial automation equipment such as programmable machinery and industrial robots may not have a usb interface data and programs are then loaded from disks damageable in industrial environments this equipment may not be replaced due to cost or requirement for continuous availability existing software emulation and virtualization do not solve this problem because no operating system is present or a customized operating system is used that has no drivers for usb devices hardware floppy disk emulators can be made to interface floppy disk controllers to a usb port that can be used for flash drives corporate computer environments may still make use of floppy disks for older machines that do not support the current company networks and in the case of laptops where wi fi is not considered secure the floppy disk provides for a controlled means of file transfer by permitting only a few files to be transmitted this is as usb ports on enterprise computer terminals workstations are often disabled in order to prevent employees from using a flash memory drive to take large amounts of data for unauthorized use the capacity limit and low transfer speed of the floppy disk are advantages in this case in addition the loss of a floppy disk has less consequence than the loss of any modern piece of removable flash storage and furthermore the floppy disk being much larger than most flash memory card formats some of which are smaller than a fingernail is harder to lose the abundance of old floppy drives has enabled forensics investigators to repurpose older computers as front ends for forensic access to old floppy disks that have only recently been unearthed from some crime scenes in may 2016 the united states government accountability office released a report that covered the need to upgrade or replace legacy computer systems within federal agencies according to this document old ibm series 1 minicomputers running on 8 inch floppy disks are still used to coordinate the operational functions of the united states nuclear forces the government plans to update some of the technology by the end of the 2017 fiscal year windows 10 no longer includes a generic driver for usb floppy drives screenshot depicting an fd as save icon for more than two decades the floppy disk was the primary external writable storage device used most computing environments before the 1990s were non networked and floppy disks were the primary means of transferring data between computers a method known informally as sneakernet unlike hard disks floppy disks are handled and seen even a novice user can identify a floppy disk because of these factors a picture of a 3 inch floppy disk has become an interface metaphor for saving data the floppy disk symbol is still used by software on user interface elements related to saving files such as the release of microsoft office 2013 even though the physical floppy disks are largely obsolete inside the 8 inch floppy disk disk notcher converts single sided 5 inch diskettes to double sided the 8 inch and 5 inch floppy disks contain a magnetically coated round plastic medium with a large circular hole in the center for a drive s spindle the medium is contained in a square plastic cover that has a small oblong opening in both sides to allow the drive s heads to read and write data and a large hole in the center to allow the magnetic medium to spin by rotating it from its middle hole inside the cover are two layers of fabric with the magnetic medium sandwiched in the middle the fabric is designed to reduce friction between the medium and the outer cover and catch particles of debris abraded off the disk to keep them from accumulating on the heads the cover is usually a one part sheet double folded with flaps glued or spot welded together a small notch disk identifies that it is writable detected by a mechanical switch or phototransistor above it if it is not present the disk can be written in the 8 inch disk the notch is covered to enable writing while in the 5 inch disk the notch is open to enable writing tape may be used over the notch to change the mode of the disk punch devices were sold to convert read only disks to writable ones and enable writing on the unused side of single sided disks such modified disks became known as flippy disks another led photo transistor pair located near the center of the disk detects the index hole once per rotation in the magnetic disk it is used to detect the angular start of each track and whether or not the disk is rotating at the correct speed early 8 inch and 5 inch disks had physical holes for each sector and were termed hard sectored disks later soft sectored disks have only one index hole and sector position is determined by the disk controller or low level software from patterns marking the start of a sector generally the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks with only the disks and controllers differing some operating systems utilizing soft sectors such as apple dos do not use the index hole the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor this was mainly a hardware cost saving measure the core of the 3 inch disk is the same as the other two disks but the front has only a label and a small opening for reading and writing data protected by the shutter a spring loaded metal or plastic cover pushed to the side on entry into the drive rather than having a hole in the center it has a metal hub which mates to the spindle of the drive typical 3 inch disk magnetic coating materials are dd 2 m magnetic iron oxide hd 1.2 m cobalt doped iron oxide ed 3 m barium ferrite two holes at the bottom left and right indicate whether the disk is write protected and whether it is high density these holes are spaced as far apart as the holes in punched a4 paper allowing write protected high density floppies to be clipped into standard ring binders a notch at top right ensures that the disk is in the correct orientation and an arrow at top left indicates direction of insertion the drive usually has a button that when pressed ejects the disk with varying degrees of force the discrepancy due to the ejection force provided by the spring of the shutter in ibm pc compatibles commodores apple ii iiis and other non apple macintosh machines with standard floppy disk drives a disk may be ejected manually at any time the drive has a disk change switch that detects when a disk is ejected or inserted failure of this mechanical switch is a common source of disk corruption if a disk is changed and the drive and hence the operating system fails to notice one of the chief usability problems of the floppy disk is its vulnerability even inside a closed plastic housing the disk medium is highly sensitive to dust condensation and temperature extremes as with all magnetic storage it is vulnerable to magnetic fields blank disks have been distributed with an extensive set of warnings cautioning the user not to expose it to dangerous conditions disks must not be roughly treated or removed from the drive while the magnetic media is still spinning since doing so is likely to cause damage to the disk drive head or stored data on the other hand the 3 inch floppy has been lauded for its mechanical usability by hci expert donald norman a simple example of a good design is the 3 inch magnetic diskette for computers a small circle of floppy magnetic material encased in hard plastic earlier types of floppy disks did not have this plastic case which protects the magnetic material from abuse and damage a sliding metal cover protects the delicate magnetic surface when the diskette is not in use and automatically opens when the diskette is inserted into the computer the diskette has a square shape there are apparently eight possible ways to insert it into the machine only one of which is correct what happens if i do it wrong i try inserting the disk sideways ah the designer thought of that a little study shows that the case really isn t square it s rectangular so you can t insert a longer side i try backward the diskette goes in only part of the way small protrusions indentations and cutouts prevent the diskette from being inserted backward or upside down of the eight ways one might try to insert the diskette only one is correct and only that one will fit an excellent design the spindle motor from a 3 inch unit a read write head from a 3 inch unit how the read write head is applied on the floppy visualization of magnetic information on floppy disk image recorded with cmos magview a spindle motor in the drive rotates the magnetic medium at a certain speed while a stepper motor operated mechanism moves the magnetic read write head s radially along the surface of the disk both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media an action originally accomplished by a disk load solenoid later drives held the heads out of contact until a front panel lever was rotated 5 or disk insertion was complete 3 to write data current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates the head s magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media when the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction encoding one bit of data to read data the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it this small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data checks it for errors and sends it to the host computer system a blank unformatted diskette has a coating of magnetic oxide with no magnetic order to the particles during formatting the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks each broken up into sectors enabling the controller to properly read and write data the tracks are concentric rings around the center with spaces between tracks where no data is written gaps with padding bytes are provided between the sectors and at the end of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk a cyclic redundancy check crc is written into the sector headers and at the end of the user data so that the disk controller can detect potential errors some errors are soft and can be resolved by automatically re trying the read operation other errors are permanent and the disk controller will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail after a disk is inserted a catch or lever at the front of the drive is manually lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging engage the spindle clamping hub and in two sided drives engage the second read write head with the media in some 5 inch drives insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever this enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal newer 5 inch drives and all 3 inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted doing the opposite with the press of the eject button on apple macintosh computers with built in floppy drives the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive the user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk in the case of a power failure or drive malfunction a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive s front panel just as one would do with a cd rom drive in a similar situation before a disk can be accessed the drive needs to synchronize its head position with the disk tracks in some drives this is accomplished with a track zero sensor while for others it involves the drive head striking an immobile reference surface in either case the head is moved so that it is approaching track zero position of the disk when a drive with the sensor has reached track zero the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned for a drive without the sensor the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero knowing that once this motion is complete the head will be positioned over track zero some drive mechanisms such as the apple ii 5.25 inch drive without a track zero sensor produce very characteristic mechanical noises when trying to move the heads past the reference surface this physical striking is responsible for the 5.25 inch drive clicking during the boot of an apple ii and the loud rattles of its dos and prodos when disk errors occurred and track zero synchronization was attempted main articles floppy disk format and list of floppy disk formats different sizes of floppy disks are mechanically incompatible and disks can fit only one size of drive drive assemblies with both 3 inch and 5 inch slots were available during the transition period between the sizes but they contained two separate drive mechanisms in addition there are many subtle usually software driven incompatibilities between the two 5 inch disks formatted for use with apple ii computers would be unreadable and treated as unformatted on a commodore as computer platforms began to form attempts were made at interchangeability for example the superdrive included from the macintosh se to the power macintosh g3 could read write and format ibm pc format 3 inch disks but few ibm compatible computers had drives that did the reverse 8 inch 5 inch and 3 inch drives were manufactured in a variety of sizes most to fit standardized drive bays alongside the common disk sizes were non classical sizes for specialized systems the first floppy disk was 8 inches in diameter was protected by a flexible plastic jacket and was a read only device used by ibm as a way of loading microcode read write floppy disks and their drives became available in 1972 but it was ibm s 1973 introduction of the 3740 data entry system that began the establishment of floppy disks called by ibm the diskette 1 as an industry standard for information interchange early microcomputers used for engineering business or word processing often used one or more 8 inch disk drives for removable storage the cp m operating system was developed for microcomputers with 8 inch drives the family of 8 inch disks and drives increased over time and later versions could store up to 1.2 mb many microcomputer applications did not need that much capacity on one disk so a smaller size disk with lower cost media and drives was feasible the 5 inch drive succeeded the 8 inch size in many applications and developed to about the same storage capacity as the original 8 inch size using higher density media and recording techniques 5.25 floppies front and back uncovered 5 inch disk mechanism with disk inserted the head gap of an 80 track high density 1.2 mb in the mfm format 5 inch drive a k a mini diskette mini disk or minifloppy is smaller than that of a 40 track double density 360 kb drive but can format read and write 40 track disks well provided the controller supports double stepping or has a switch to do such a process 5.25 inch 80 track drives were also called hyper drives a blank 40 track disk formatted and written on an 80 track drive can be taken to its native drive without problems and a disk formatted on a 40 track drive can be used on an 80 track drive disks written on a 40 track drive and then updated on an 80 track drive become unreadable on any 40 track drives due to track width incompatibility single sided disks were coated on both sides despite the availability of more expensive double sided disks the reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error free on both sides of the media double sided disks could be used in some drives for single sided disks as long as an index signal was not needed this was done one side at a time by turning them over flippy disks more expensive dual head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced and eventually became used universally internal parts of a 3 inch floppy disk 1 a hole that indicates a high capacity disk 2 the

unlabeled is upper left a 3 inch floppy disk drive in the early 1980s a number of manufacturers introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats a consortium of 21 companies eventually settled on a 3 inch floppy disk actually 90 mm wide a k a micro diskette micro disk or micro floppy similar to a sony design but improved to support both single sided and double sided media with formatted capacities generally of 360 kb and 720 kb respectively single sided drives shipped in 1983 and double sided in 1984 what became the most common format the double sided high density hd 1.44 mb disk drive shipped in 1986 the first macintosh computers used single sided 3 inch floppy disks but with 400 kb formatted capacity these were followed in 1986 by double sided 800 kb floppies the higher capacity was achieved at the same recording density by varying the disk rotation speed with head position so that the linear speed of the disk was closer to constant later macs could also read and write 1.44 mb hd disks in pc format with fixed rotation speed all 3 inch disks have a rectangular hole in one corner which if obstructed write enabled the disk a sliding detented piece can be moved to block or reveal the part of the rectangular hole that is sensed by the drive the hd 1.44 mb disks have a second unobstructed hole in the opposite corner which identifies them as being of that capacity in ibm compatible pcs the three densities of 3 inch floppy disks are backwards compatible higher density drives can read write and format lower density media it is also possible to format a disk at a lower density than it was intended for but only if the disk is first thoroughly demagnetized with a bulk eraser as the high density format is magnetically stronger and will prevent the disk from working in lower density modes writing at different densities than disks were intended for sometimes by altering or drilling holes was possible but deprecated the holes on the right side of a 3 inch disk can be altered as to make some disk drives and operating systems treat the disk as one of higher or lower density for bidirectional compatibility or economical reasons some computers such as the ps 2 and acorn archimedes ignored these holes altogether it is possible to make a 3 inch floppy disk drive be recognized by a system as a 5 inch 360 kb or 1200 kb drive and to read and write disks with the same number of tracks and sectors as those disks this had some application in data exchange with obsolete cp m systems main article floppy disk variants other smaller floppy sizes were proposed especially for portable or pocket sized devices that needed a smaller storage device 3 inch disks similar in construction to 3 inch were manufactured and used for a time particularly by amstrad computers and word processors a 2 inch nominal size known as the video floppy was introduced by sony for use with its mavica still video camera an incompatible 2 inch floppy was produced by fujifilm called the lt-1 was used in the zenith minisport portable computer neither of these sizes achieved much market success main article list of floppy disk formats floppy disk size is often referred to in inches even in countries using metric and though the size is defined in metric the ansi specification of 3 inch disks is entitled in part 90 mm 3.5 inch though 90 mm is closer to 3.54

formats spare hidden and otherwise reserved sectors are included in this number for 5 and 3 inch capacities quoted are from subsystem or system vendor statements marketed capacity is the capacity typically unformatted by the original media oem vendor or in the case of ibm media the first oem thereafter other formats may get more or less capacity from the same drives and disks a box of about 80 floppy disks together with one usb memory stick the stick is capable of holding over 130 times as much data as the entire box of disks put together data is generally written to floppy disks in sectors angular blocks and tracks concentric rings at a constant radius for example the hd format of 3 inch floppy disks uses 512 bytes per sector 18 sectors per track 80 tracks per side and two sides for a total of 1,474,560 bytes per disk some disk controllers can vary these parameters at the user s request increasing storage on the disk although they may not be able to be read on machines with other controllers for example microsoft applications were often distributed on 3 inch 1.68 mb dmf disks formatted with 21 sectors instead of 18 they could still be recognized by a standard controller on the ibm pc msx and most other microcomputer platforms disks were written using a constant angular velocity cav format with the disk spinning at a constant speed and the sectors holding the same amount of information on each track regardless of radial location because the sectors have constant angular size the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more near the disk s center a more space efficient technique would be to increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk from 18 to 30 for instance thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector an example is zone bit recording apple implemented this in early macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge while maintaining the data rate allowing 400 kb of storage per side and an extra 160 kb on a double sided disk this higher capacity came with a disadvantage the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry meaning that mac disks could not be read on other computers apple eventually reverted to constant angular velocity on hd floppy disks with their later machines still unique to apple as they supported the older variable speed formats disk formatting is usually done by a utility program supplied by the computer os manufacturer generally it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk and initializes its sectors and tracks areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked marked as bad sectors so that the operating system does not attempt to use them this was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process when floppy disks were often used disks pre formatted for popular computers were sold the unformatted capacity of a floppy disk does not include the sector and track headings of a formatted disk the difference in storage between them depends on the drive s application floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity for example 2 mb for a standard 3 inch hd floppy it is implied that this should not be exceeded since doing so will most likely result in performance problems dmf was introduced permitting 1.68 mb to fit onto an otherwise standard 3 inch disk utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such mixtures of decimal prefixes and binary sector sizes require care to properly calculate total capacity whereas semiconductor memory naturally favors powers of two size doubles each time an address pin is added to the integrated circuit the capacity of a disk drive is the product of sector size sectors per track tracks per side and sides which in hard disk drives with multiple platters can be greater than 2 although other sector sizes have been known in the past formatted sector sizes are now almost always set to powers of two 256 bytes 512 bytes etc and in some cases disk capacity is calculated as multiples of the sector size rather than only in bytes leading to a combination of decimal multiples of sectors and binary sector sizes for example 1.44 mb 3 inch hd disks have the m prefix peculiar to their context coming from their capacity of 2,880 512 byte sectors 1,440 kib consistent with neither a decimal megabyte nor a binary mebibyte mib hence these disks hold 1.47 mb or 1.41 mib usable data capacity is a function of the disk format used which in turn is determined by the fdd controller and its settings differences between such formats can result in capacities ranging from approximately 1300 to 1760 kib 1.80 mb on a standard 3 inch high density floppy and up to nearly 2 mb with utilities such as 2m 2mgui the highest capacity techniques require much tighter matching of drive head geometry between drives something not always possible and unreliable for example the ls-240 drive supports a 32 mb capacity on standard 3 inch hd disks but it is however a write once technique and requires its own drive the raw maximum transfer rate of 3 inch hd floppy drives and interfaces disregarding overheads is as much as 1,000 kilobits s or approximately 83 that of single speed cd rom 71 of audio cd this represents the speed of raw data bits moving under the read head however the effective speed is somewhat less due to space used for headers gaps and other format fields berg connector for 3.5 floppy drive dd unix disk image don t copy
