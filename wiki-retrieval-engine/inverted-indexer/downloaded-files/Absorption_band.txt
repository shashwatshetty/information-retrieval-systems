bands in the earth s atmosphere created by greenhouse gases and the resulting effects on transmitted radiation according to quantum mechanics atoms and molecules can only hold certain defined quantities of energy or exist in specific states when such quanta of electromagnetic radiation are emitted or absorbed by an atom or molecule the energy of the radiation changes the state of the atom or molecule from an initial state to a final state an absorption band is a range of wavelengths frequencies or energies in the electromagnetic spectrum which are characteristic of a particular transition from initial to final state in a substance contents according to quantum mechanics atoms and molecules can only hold certain defined quantities of energy or exist in specific states when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by an atom or molecule the energy of the radiation changes the state of the atom or molecule from an initial state to a final state the number of states in a specific energy range is discrete for gaseous or diluted systems with discrete energy levels condensed systems like liquids or solids have a continuous density of states distribution and often possess continuous energy bands in order for a substance to change its energy it must do so in a series of steps by the absorption of a photon this absorption process can move a particle like an electron from an occupied state to an empty or unoccupied state it can also move a whole vibrating or rotating system like a molecule from one vibrational or rotational state to another or it can create a quasiparticle like a phonon or a plasmon in a solid schematic diagram of electromagnetic absorption when a photon is absorbed the electromagnetic field of the photon disappears as it initiates a change in the state of the system that absorbs the photon energy momentum angular momentum magnetic dipole moment and electric dipole moment are transported from the photon to the system because there are conservation laws that have to be satisfied the transition has to meet a series of constraints this results in a series of selection rules it is not possible to make any transition that lies within the energy or frequency range that is observed the strength of an electromagnetic absorption process is mainly determined by two factors first it is important to realize that transitions that only change the magnetic dipole moment of the system are much weaker than transitions that change the electric dipole moment and that transitions to higher order moments like quadrupole transitions are weaker than dipole transitions second not all transitions have the same transition matrix element absorption coefficient or oscillator strength for some types of bands or spectroscopic disciplines temperature and statistical mechanics plays an important role for far infrared microwave and radio frequency ranges the temperature dependent occupation numbers of states and the difference between bose einstein statistics and fermi dirac statistics determines the intensity of observed absorptions for other energy ranges thermal motion effects like doppler broadening may determine the linewidth a m ssbauer absorption spectrum of 57fe with very sharp lines main article spectroscopic line shape a wide variety of absorption band and line shapes exist and the analysis of the band or line shape can be used to determine information about the system that causes it in many cases it is convenient to assume that a narrow spectral line is a lorentzian or gaussian depending respectively on the decay mechanism or temperature effects like doppler broadening analysis of the spectral density and the intensities width and shape of spectral lines sometimes can yield a lot of information about the observed system like it is done with m ssbauer spectra in systems with a very large number of states like macromolecules and large conjugated systems the separate energy levels can t always be distinguished in an absorption spectrum if the line broadening mechanism is known and the shape of then spectral density is clearly visible in the spectrum it is possible to get the desired data sometimes it is enough to know the lower or upper limits of the band or its position for an analysis for condensed matter and solids the shape of absorption bands are often determined by transitions between states in their continuous density of states distributions for crystals the electronic band structure determines the density of states in fluids glasses and amorphous solids there is no long range correlation and the dispersion relations are isotropic this makes density of states calculations of absorption band shapes easier for charge transfer complexes and conjugated systems the band width is determined by a variety of factors electromagnetic transitions in atoms molecules and condensed matter mainly take place at energies corresponding to the uv and visible part of the spectrum core electrons in atoms and a lot of other phenomena are observed with different brands of xas in the x ray energy range electromagnetic transitions in atomic nuclei as observed in m ssbauer spectroscopy take place in the gamma ray part of the spectrum the main factors that cause broadening of the spectral line into an absorption band of a molecular solid are the distributions of vibrational and rotational energies of the molecules in the sample and also those of their excited states in solid crystals the shape of absorption bands are determined by the density of states of initial and final states of electronic states or lattice vibrations called phonons in the crystal structure in gas phase spectroscopy the fine structure afforded by these factors can be discerned but in solution state spectroscopy the differences in molecular micro environments further broaden the structure to give smooth bands electronic transition bands of molecules may be from tens to several hundred nanometers in breadth vibrational transitions and optical phonon transitions take place in the infrared part of the spectrum at wavelengths of around 1-30 micrometres rotational transitions take place in the far infrared and microwave regions absorption bands in the radio frequency range are found in nmr spectroscopy the frequency ranges and intensities are determined by the magnetic moment of the nuclei that are observed the applied magnetic field and temperature occupation number differences of the magnetic states materials with broad absorption bands are being applied in
