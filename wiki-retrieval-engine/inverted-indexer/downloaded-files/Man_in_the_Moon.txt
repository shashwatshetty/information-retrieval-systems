berlin germany approximately 30 minutes after moonrise common interpretation of the man in the moon as seen from the northern hemisphere modeled appearance for same longitude 30 minutes after moonrise the man in the moon is struck by a spacecraft in the 1902 fantasy film le voyage dans la lune this frame from the film is an example of a conventionalized image bearing no relation to actual lunar features the man in the moon refers to any of several pareidolic images of a human face head or body that certain traditions recognise in the disc of the full moon the images are composed of the dark areas of the lunar maria or seas and the lighter highlands of the lunar surface contents one older european tradition sees a figure of a man carrying a wide burden on his back he is sometimes seen as accompanied by a small dog various cultures recognise other examples of lunar pareidolia such as the moon rabbit in the northern hemisphere a common western perception of the face has it that the figure s eyes are mare imbrium and mare serenitatis its nose is sinus aestuum and its open mouth is mare nubium and mare cognitum this particular human face can also be seen in tropical regions on both sides of the equator however the moon orientation associated with the face is observed less frequently and eventually not at all as one moves towards the south pole conventionalized illustrations of the man in the moon seen in western art often show a very simple face in the full moon or a human profile in the crescent moon corresponding to no actual markings the man in the moon can also refer to a mythological character said to live on or in the moon but who is not necessarily represented by the markings on the face of the moon an example is yue laou from chinese tradition there are various explanations for how the man in the moon came to be a longstanding european tradition holds that the man was banished to the moon for some crime christian lore commonly held that he is the man caught gathering sticks on the sabbath and sentenced by god to death by stoning in the book of numbers xv.32-36 some germanic cultures thought he was a man caught stealing from a neighbor s hedgerow

this for now doth cain with fork of thorns confine on either hemisphere touching the wave beneath the towers of seville yesternight the moon was round this is mentioned again in his paradise but tell i pray thee whence the gloomy spots upon this body which below on earth give rise to talk of cain in fabling quaint there is also a talmudic tradition that the image of jacob is engraved on the moon

the south and burnt his mouth with supping cold pease porridge the man in the moon is made up of various lunar maria which ones depends on the pareidolic image seen these vast flat spots on the moon are called maria or seas because for a long time astronomers believed they were large bodies of water they are large areas formed by lava that covered up old craters and then cooled becoming smooth basalt rock the near side of the moon containing these maria that make up the man is always facing earth this is due to a tidal locking or synchronous orbit thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the moon s oblong shape its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the earth this causes the near side of the moon to always turn its face toward earth man in the moon lore moon illusions the man in the moon and other weird things the man in the moon v t e the moon physical properties internal structure topography
