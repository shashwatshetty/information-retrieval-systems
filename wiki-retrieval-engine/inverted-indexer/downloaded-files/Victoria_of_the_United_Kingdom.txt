throne at the age of 18 after her father s three elder brothers had all died leaving no surviving legitimate children the united kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power privately victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments publicly she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality victoria married her first cousin prince albert of saxe coburg and gotha in 1840 their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent tying them together and earning her the sobriquet the grandmother of europe after albert s death in 1861 victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances as a result of her seclusion republicanism temporarily gained strength but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered her golden and diamond jubilees were times of public celebration her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than that of any of her predecessors and is known as the victorian era it was a period of industrial cultural political scientific and military change within the united kingdom and was marked by a great expansion of the british empire she was the last british monarch of the house of hanover her son and successor edward vii initiated the house of saxe coburg and gotha the line of his father contents portrait of victoria aged four by stephen poyntz denning 1823 victoria s father was prince edward duke of kent and strathearn the fourth son of the reigning king of the united kingdom george iii until 1817 edward s niece princess charlotte of wales was the only legitimate grandchild of george iii her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the duke of kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children in 1818 he married princess victoria of saxe coburg saalfeld a widowed german princess with two children carl 1804 1856 and feodora 1807 1872 by her first marriage to the prince of leiningen her brother leopold was princess charlotte s widower the duke and duchess of kent s only child victoria was born at 4.15 a m on 24may 1819 at kensington palace in london victoria was christened privately by the archbishop of canterbury charles manners sutton on 24june 1819 in the cupola room at kensington palace she was baptised alexandrina after one of her godparents emperor alexander i of russia and victoria after her mother additional names proposed by her parents georgina or georgiana charlotte and augusta were dropped on the instructions of the duke s eldest brother george the prince regent at birth victoria was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of georgeiii george the prince regent later georgeiv frederick the duke of york william the duke of clarence later williamiv and victoria s father edward the duke of kent the prince regent had no surviving children and the duke of york had no children further both were estranged from their wives who were both past child bearing age so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children the duke of clarence and the duke of kent married on the same day in 1818 but both of clarence s daughters born in 1819 and 1820 died as infants victoria s father died in january 1820 when victoria was less than a year old a week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son georgeiv the duke of york died in 1827 when georgeiv died in 1830 he was succeeded by his next surviving brother williamiv and victoria became heir presumptive the regency act 1830 made special provision for the duchess of kent victoria s mother to act as regent in case william died while victoria was still a minor king william distrusted the duchess s capacity to be regent and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until victoria s 18th birthday so that a regency could be avoided portrait of victoria with her spaniel dash by george hayter 1833 victoria later described her childhood as rather melancholy her mother was extremely protective and victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so called kensington system an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller sir john conroy who was rumoured to be the duchess s lover the system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and conroy deemed undesirable including most of her father s family and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them the duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of king william s illegitimate children and perhaps prompted the emergence of victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night studied with private tutors to a regular timetable and spent her play hours with her dolls and her king charles spaniel dash her lessons included french german italian and latin but she spoke only english at home self portrait 1835 in 1830 the duchess of kent and conroy took victoria across the centre of england to visit the malvern hills stopping at towns and great country houses along the way similar journeys to other parts of england and wales were taken in 1832 1833 1834 and 1835 to the king s annoyance victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops william compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive victoria disliked the trips the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill and there was little time for her to rest she objected on the grounds of the king s disapproval but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy and forced victoria to continue the tours at ramsgate in october 1835 victoria contracted a severe fever which conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence while victoria was ill conroy and the duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make conroy her private secretary as a teenager victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and conroy to appoint him to her staff once queen she banned him from her presence but he remained in her mother s household by 1836 the duchess s brother leopold who had been king of the belgians since 1831 hoped to marry his niece to his nephew prince albert of saxe coburg and gotha leopold victoria s mother and albert s father ernest i duke of saxe coburg and gotha were siblings leopold arranged for victoria s mother to invite her coburg relatives to visit her in may 1836 with the purpose of introducing victoria to albert william iv however disapproved of any match with the coburgs and instead favoured the suit of prince alexander of the netherlands second son of the prince of orange victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes according to her diary she enjoyed albert s company from the beginning after the visit she wrote albert is extremely handsome his hair is about the same colour as mine his eyes are large and blue and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth but the charm of his countenance is his expression which is most delightful alexander on the other hand was very plain victoria wrote to her uncle leopold whom victoria considered her best and kindest adviser to thank him for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed to give me in the person of dear albert he possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy he is so sensible so kind and so good and so amiable too he has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see however at 17 victoria though interested in albert was not yet ready to marry the parties did not undertake a formal engagement but assumed that the match

kingdom in her diary she wrote i was awoke at 6 o clock by mamma who told me the archbishop of canterbury and lord conyngham were here and wished to see me i got out of bed and went into my sitting room only in my dressing gown and alone and saw them lord conyngham then acquainted me that my poor uncle the king was no more and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning and consequently that i am queen official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as alexandrina victoria but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again since 1714 britain had shared a monarch with hanover in germany but under salic law women were excluded from the hanoverian succession while victoria inherited all the british dominions hanover passed instead to her father s younger brother her unpopular uncle the duke of cumberland who became king of hanover he was her heir presumptive until she married and had a child coronation portrait by george hayter at the time of her accession the government was led by the whig prime minister lord melbourne the prime minister at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced queen who relied on him for advice charles greville supposed that the widowed and childless melbourne was passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one and victoria probably saw him as a father figure her coronation took place on 28 june 1838 at westminster abbey over 400,000 visitors came to london for the celebrations she became the first sovereign to take up residence at buckingham palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of lancaster and cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of 385,000 per year financially prudent she paid off her father s debts at the start of her reign victoria was popular but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother s ladies in waiting lady flora hastings developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out of wedlock pregnancy by sir john conroy victoria believed the rumours she hated conroy and despised that odious lady flora because she had conspired with conroy and the duchess of kent in the kensington system at first lady flora refused to submit to an intimate medical examination until in mid february she eventually agreed and was found to be a virgin conroy the hastings family and the opposition tories organised a press campaign implicating the queen in the spreading of false rumours about lady flora when lady flora died in july the post mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen at public appearances victoria was hissed and jeered as mrs melbourne in 1839 melbourne resigned after radicals and tories both of whom victoria detested voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of jamaica the bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery the queen commissioned a tory sir robert peel to form a new ministry at the time it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the royal household who were usually his political allies and their spouses many of the queen s ladies of the bedchamber were wives of whigs and peel expected to replace them with wives of tories in what became known as the bedchamber crisis victoria advised by melbourne objected to their removal peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the queen and consequently resigned his commission allowing melbourne to return to office see also wedding

despite their differences over the kensington system and her mother s continued reliance on conroy her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in buckingham palace and victoria often refused to see her when victoria complained to melbourne that her mother s close proximity promised torment for many years melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage which victoria called a schocking sic alternative victoria showed interest in albert s education for the future role he would have to play as her husband but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock victoria continued to praise albert following his second visit in october 1839 albert and victoria felt mutual affection and the queen proposed to him on 15 october 1839 just five days after he had arrived at windsor they were married on 10 february 1840 in the chapel royal of st james s palace london victoria was besotted she spent the evening after their wedding lying down with a headache but wrote ecstatically in her diary i never never spent such an evening my dearest dearest dear albert his excessive love affection gave me feelings of heavenly love happiness i never could have hoped to have felt before he clasped me in his arms we kissed each other again again his beauty his sweetness gentleness really how can i ever be thankful enough to have such a husband to be called by names of tenderness i have never yet heard used to me before was bliss beyond belief oh this was the happiest day of my life albert became an important political adviser as well as the queen s companion replacing lord melbourne

discontent over the hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis her daughter also named victoria was born on 21 november 1840 the queen hated being pregnant viewed breast feeding with disgust and

arthur b 1850 leopold b 1853 and beatrice b 1857 victoria s household was largely run by her childhood governess baroness louise lehzen from hanover lehzen had been a formative influence on victoria and had supported her against the kensington system albert however thought that lehzen was incompetent and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter s health after a furious row between victoria

along the mall london when john francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire the assailant escaped however the following day victoria drove the same route though faster and with a greater escort in a deliberate attempt to provoke francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act as expected francis shot at her but he was seized by plainclothes policemen and convicted of high treason on 3 july two days after francis s death sentence was commuted to transportation for life john william bean also tried to fire a pistol at the queen but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge edward oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840 bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail in a similar attack in 1849 unemployed irishman william hamilton fired a powder filled pistol at victoria s carriage as it passed along constitution hill london in 1850 the queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex

equivalent to between 177,700 and 6.5 million in 2016 to the british relief association more than any other individual famine relief donor and also supported the maynooth grant to a roman catholic seminary in ireland despite protestant opposition the story that she donated only 5 in aid to the irish and on the same day gave the same amount to battersea dogs home was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century by 1846 peel s ministry faced a crisis involving the repeal of the corn laws many tories by then known also as conservatives were opposed to the repeal but peel some tories the

british royal family and the house of orleans who were related by marriage through the coburgs in 1843 and 1845 she and albert stayed with king louis philippe i at ch teau d eu in normandy she was the first british or english monarch to visit a french monarch since the meeting of henry viii of england and francis i of france on the field of the cloth of gold in 1520 when louis philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844 he became the first french king to visit a british sovereign louis philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 and fled to exile in england at the height of a revolutionary scare in the united kingdom in april 1848 victoria and her family left london for the greater safety of osborne house a private estate on the isle of wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped demonstrations by chartists and irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support and the scare died down without any major disturbances victoria s first visit to ireland in 1849 was a public relations success but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of irish nationalism russell s ministry though whig was not favoured by the queen she found particularly offensive the foreign secretary lord palmerston who often acted without consulting the cabinet the prime minister or the queen victoria complained to russell that palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge but palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative despite her repeated remonstrances it was only in 1851 that palmerston was removed after he announced the british government s approval of president louis napoleon bonaparte s coup in france without consulting the prime minister the following year president bonaparte was declared emperor

albert edward leopold louise victoria with beatrice alfred victoria and helena in 1853 victoria gave birth to her eighth child leopold with the aid of the new anaesthetic chloroform victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child beatrice despite opposition from members of the clergy who considered it against biblical teaching and members of the medical profession who thought it dangerous victoria may have suffered from postnatal depression after many of her pregnancies letters from albert to victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self control for example about a month after leopold s birth albert complained in a letter to victoria about her continuance of hysterics over a miserable trifle in early 1855 the government of lord aberdeen who had replaced derby fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of british troops in the crimean war victoria approached both derby and russell to form a ministry but neither had sufficient support and victoria was forced to appoint palmerston as prime minister napoleon iii since the crimean war britain s closest ally visited london in april 1855 and from 17 to 28 august the same year victoria and albert returned the visit napoleon iii met the couple at boulogne and accompanied them to paris they visited the exposition universelle a successor to albert s 1851 brainchild the great exhibition and napoleon i s tomb at les invalides to which his remains had only been returned in 1840 and were guests of honour

the french military port of cherbourg on 5 august 1858 in an attempt by napoleon iii to reassure britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere on her return victoria wrote to derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the royal navy in comparison to the french one derby s ministry did not last long and in june 1859 victoria recalled palmerston to office eleven days after orsini s assassination attempt in france victoria s eldest daughter married prince frederick william of prussia in london they had been betrothed since september 1855 when princess victoria was 14 years old the marriage was delayed by the queen and prince albert until the bride was 17 the queen and albert hoped that their daughter and son in law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging prussian state victoria felt sick at heart to see her daughter leave england for germany it really makes me shudder she wrote to princess victoria in one of her frequent letters when i look round to all your sweet happy unconscious sisters and think i must give them up too one by one almost exactly a year later princess victoria gave birth to the queen s first grandchild wilhelm who would become the last german kaiser victoria photographed by j j e mayall 1860 in march 1861 victoria s mother died with victoria at her side through reading her mother s papers victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply she was heart broken and blamed conroy and lehzen for wickedly estranging her from her mother to relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief albert took on most of her duties despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble in august victoria and albert visited their son the prince of wales who was attending army manoeuvres near dublin and spent a few days holidaying in killarney in november albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in ireland appalled albert travelled to cambridge where his son was studying to confront him by the beginning of december albert was very unwell he was diagnosed with typhoid fever by william jenner and died on 14 december 1861 victoria was devastated she blamed her husband s death on worry over the prince of wales s philandering he had been killed by that dreadful business she said she entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life she avoided public appearances and rarely set foot in london in the following years her seclusion earned her the nickname widow of windsor victoria s self imposed isolation from the public diminished the popularity of the monarchy and encouraged the growth of the republican movement she did undertake her official government duties yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences windsor castle osborne house and the private estate in scotland that she and albert had acquired in 1847 balmoral castle in march 1864 a protester stuck a notice on the railings of buckingham palace that announced these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant s declining business her uncle leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public she agreed to visit the gardens of the royal horticultural society at kensington and take a drive through london in an open carriage victoria and john brown at balmoral 1863 photograph by g w wilson through the 1860s victoria relied increasingly on a manservant from scotland john brown slanderous rumours of a romantic connection and even a secret marriage appeared in print and the queen was referred to as mrs brown the story of their relationship was the subject of the 1997 movie mrs brown a painting by sir edwin henry landseer depicting the queen with brown was exhibited at the royal academy and victoria published a book leaves from the journal of our life in the highlands which featured brown prominently and in which the queen praised him highly palmerston died in 1865 and after a brief ministry led by russell derby returned to power in 1866 victoria attended the state opening of parliament for the first time since albert s death the following year she supported the passing of the reform act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men though she was not in favour of votes for women derby resigned in 1868 to be replaced by benjamin disraeli who charmed victoria everyone likes flattery he said and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel with the phrase we authors ma am he complimented her disraeli s ministry only lasted a matter of months and at the end of the year his liberal rival william ewart gladstone was appointed prime minister victoria found gladstone s demeanour far less appealing he spoke to her she is thought to have complained as though she were a public meeting rather than a woman in 1870 republican sentiment in britain fed by the queen s seclusion was boosted after the establishment of the third french republic a republican rally in trafalgar square demanded victoria s removal and radical mps spoke against her in august and september 1871 she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm which joseph lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray in late november 1871 at the height of the republican movement the prince of wales contracted typhoid fever the disease that was believed to have killed his father and victoria was fearful her son would die as the tenth anniversary of her husband s death approached her son s condition grew no better and victoria s distress continued to general rejoicing he pulled through mother and son attended a public parade through london and a grand service of thanksgiving in st paul s cathedral on 27 february 1872 and republican feeling subsided on the last day of february 1872 two days after the thanksgiving service 17 year old arthur o connor great nephew of irish mp feargus o connor waved an unloaded pistol at victoria s open carriage just after she had arrived at buckingham palace brown who was attending the queen grabbed him and o connor was later sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and a birching as a result of the incident victoria s popularity recovered further wikisource has original text related to this article queen victoria s proclamation after the indian rebellion of 1857 the british east india company which had ruled much of india was dissolved and britain s possessions and protectorates on the indian subcontinent were formally incorporated into the british empire the queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict and condemned atrocities on both sides she wrote of her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war and insisted urged on by albert that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state should breathe feelings of generosity benevolence and religious toleration at her behest a reference threatening the undermining of native religions and customs was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom victoria admired heinrich von angeli s 1875 portrait of her for its honesty total want of flattery and appreciation of character in the 1874 general election disraeli was returned to power he passed the public worship regulation act 1874 which removed catholic rituals from the anglican liturgy and which victoria strongly supported she preferred short simple services and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian church of scotland than the episcopal church of

of my beloved child between april 1877 and february 1878 she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring disraeli to act against russia during the russo turkish war but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the congress of berlin disraeli s expansionist foreign policy which victoria endorsed led to conflicts such as the anglo zulu war and the second anglo afghan war if we are to maintain our position as a first rate power she wrote we must be prepared for attacks and wars somewhere or other continually victoria saw the expansion of the british empire as civilising and benign protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers it is not in our custom to annexe countries she said unless we are obliged forced to do so to victoria s

at the queen as her carriage left windsor railway station two schoolboys from eton college struck him with their umbrellas until he was hustled away by a policeman victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was worth being shot at to see how much one is loved on 17 march 1883 she fell down some stairs at windsor which left her lame until july she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter brown died 10 days after her accident and to the consternation of her private secretary sir henry ponsonby victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of brown ponsonby and randall davidson dean of windsor who had both seen early drafts advised victoria against

victoria was pleased when gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated she thought his government was the worst i have ever had and blamed him for the death of general gordon at khartoum gladstone was replaced by lord salisbury salisbury s government only lasted a few months however and victoria was forced to recall gladstone whom she referred to as a half crazy really in many ways

gladstone retired and without consulting the outgoing prime minister victoria appointed lord rosebery as prime minister his government was weak and the following year lord salisbury replaced him salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of victoria s reign victoria in her official diamond jubilee photograph by w d downey on 23 september 1896 victoria surpassed her grandfather george iii as the longest reigning monarch in english scottish and british history the queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897 to coincide with her diamond jubilee which was made a festival of the british empire at the suggestion of colonial secretary joseph chamberlain the prime ministers of all the self governing dominions were invited to london for the festivities one reason for including the prime ministers of the dominions and excluding foreign heads of state was to avoid having to invite victoria s grandson wilhelm ii of germany who it was feared might cause trouble at the event the queen s diamond jubilee procession on 22 june 1897 followed a route six miles long through london and included troops from all over the empire the procession paused for an open air service of thanksgiving held outside st paul s cathedral throughout which victoria sat in her open carriage to avoid her having to climb the steps to enter the building the celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78 year old queen queen victoria in dublin 1900 victoria visited mainland europe regularly for holidays in 1889 during a stay in biarritz she became the first reigning monarch from britain to set foot in spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit by april 1900 the boer war was so unpopular in mainland europe that her annual trip to france seemed inadvisable instead the queen went to ireland for the first time since 1861 in part to acknowledge the contribution of irish regiments to the south african war in july her second son alfred affie died oh god my poor darling affie gone too she wrote in her journal it is a horrible year nothing but sadness horrors of one kind another queen victoria aged 80 1899 following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood victoria spent the christmas of 1900 at osborne house on the isle of wight rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts through early january she felt weak and unwell and by mid january she was drowsy dazed and confused she died on tuesday 22 january 1901 at half past six in the evening at the age of 81 her son and successor king edward vii and her eldest grandson emperor wilhelm ii of germany were at her deathbed her favourite pet pomeranian turi was laid upon her deathbed as a last request poster proclaiming a day of mourning in toronto on the day of victoria s funeral in 1897 victoria had written instructions for her funeral which was to be military as befitting a soldier s daughter and the head of the army and white instead of black on 25 january edward vii the kaiser and prince arthur duke of connaught helped lift her body into the coffin she was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil an array of mementos commemorating her extended family friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her at her request by her doctor and dressers one of albert s dressing gowns was placed by her side with a plaster cast of his hand while a lock of john brown s hair along with a picture of him was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers items of jewellery placed on victoria included the wedding ring of john brown s mother given to her by brown in 1883 her funeral was held on saturday 2 february in st george s chapel windsor castle and after two days of lying in state she was interred beside prince albert in frogmore mausoleum at windsor great park with a reign of 63 years seven months and two days victoria was the longest reigning british monarch and the longest reigning queen regnant in world history until her great great granddaughter elizabeth ii surpassed her on 9 september 2015 she was the last monarch of britain from the house of hanover her son and successor edward vii belonged to her husband s house of saxe coburg and gotha see also cultural depictions of queen victoria victoria amused the remark we are not amused is attributed to her but there is no direct evidence that she ever said it and she denied doing so according to one of her biographers giles st aubyn victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life from july 1832 until just before her death she kept a detailed journal which eventually encompassed 122 volumes after victoria s death her youngest daughter princess beatrice was appointed her literary executor beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering victoria s accession onwards and burned the originals in the process despite this destruction much of the diaries still exist in addition to beatrice s edited copy lord esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before beatrice destroyed them part of victoria s extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by a c benson hector bolitho george earle buckle lord esher roger fulford and richard hough among others victoria was physically unprepossessing she was stout dowdy and only about five feet tall but she succeeded in projecting a grand image she experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public biographies of victoria written before much of the primary material became available such as lytton strachey s queen victoria of 1921 are now considered out of date the biographies written by elizabeth longford and cecil woodham smith in 1964 and 1972 respectively are still widely admired they and others conclude that as a person victoria was emotional obstinate honest and straight talking through victoria s reign the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in britain continued reforms of the voting system increased the power of the house of commons at the expense of the house of lords and the monarch in 1867 walter bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn as victoria s monarchy became more symbolic than political it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values in contrast to the sexual financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the house of hanover and which had discredited the monarchy the concept of the family monarchy with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify was solidified the victoria memorial in kolkata india the victoria memorial in front of buckingham palace was erected as part of the remodelling of the fa ade of the palace a decade after her death victoria s links with europe s royal families earned her the nickname the grandmother of europe victoria and albert had 42 grandchildren of whom 34 survived to adulthood their descendants include elizabeth ii prince philip duke of edinburgh harald v of norway carl xvi gustaf of sweden margrethe ii of denmark and felipe vi of spain victoria s youngest son leopold was affected by the blood clotting disease haemophilia b and two of her five daughters alice and beatrice were carriers royal haemophiliacs descended from victoria included her great grandsons alexei nikolaevich tsarevich of russia alfonso prince of asturias and infante gonzalo of spain the presence of the disease in victoria s descendants but not in her ancestors led to modern speculation that her true father was not the duke of kent but a haemophiliac there is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with victoria s mother and as male carriers always suffer the disease even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill it is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because victoria s father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases around the world places and memorials are dedicated to her especially in the commonwealth nations places named after her include africa s largest lake victoria falls the capitals of british columbia victoria and saskatchewan regina and two australian states victoria and queensland the victoria cross was introduced in 1856 to reward acts of valour during the crimean war and it remains the highest british canadian australian and new zealand award for bravery victoria day is a canadian statutory holiday and a local public holiday in
