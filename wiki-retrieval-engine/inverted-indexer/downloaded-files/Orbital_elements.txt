from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search orbital elements are the parameters required to uniquely identify a specific orbit in celestial mechanics these elements are generally considered in classical two body systems where a kepler orbit is used there are many different ways to mathematically describe the same orbit but certain schemes each consisting of a set of six parameters are commonly used in astronomy and orbital mechanics a real orbit and its elements changes over time due to gravitational perturbations by other objects and the effects of relativity a keplerian orbit is merely an idealized mathematical approximation at a particular time contents in this diagram the orbital plane yellow intersects a reference plane gray for earth orbiting satellites the reference plane is usually the earth s equatorial plane and for satellites in solar orbits it is the ecliptic plane the intersection is called the line of nodes as it connects the center of mass with the ascending and descending nodes the reference plane together with the vernal point establishes a reference frame the traditional orbital elements are the six keplerian elements after johannes kepler and his laws of planetary motion when viewed from an inertial frame two orbiting bodies trace out distinct trajectories each of these trajectories has its focus at the common center of mass when viewed from a non inertial frame centred on one of the bodies only the trajectory of the opposite body is apparent keplerian elements describe these non inertial trajectories an orbit has two sets of keplerian elements depending on which body is used as the point of reference the reference body is called the primary the other body is called the secondary the primary does not necessarily possess more mass than the secondary and even when the bodies are of equal mass the orbital elements depend on the choice of the primary the main two elements that define the shape and size of the ellipse eccentricity shape of the ellipse describing how much it is elongated compared to a circle not marked in diagram semimajor axis the sum of the periapsis and apoapsis distances divided by two for circular orbits the semimajor axis is the distance between the centers of the bodies not the distance of the bodies from the center of mass two elements define the orientation of the orbital plane in which the ellipse is embedded inclination vertical tilt of the ellipse with respect to the reference plane measured at the ascending node where the orbit passes upward through the reference plane the green angle in the diagram tilt angle is measured perpendicular to line of intersection between orbital plane and reference plane any three points on an ellipse will define the ellipse orbital plane the plane and the ellipse are both two dimensional objects defined in three dimensional space longitude of the ascending node or horizontally orients the ascending node of the ellipse where the orbit passes upward through the reference plane with respect to the reference frame s vernal point the green angle in the diagram and finally argument of periapsis defines the orientation of the ellipse in the orbital plane as an angle measured from the ascending node to the periapsis the closest point the satellite object comes to the primary object around which it orbits the blue angle in the diagram true anomaly or at epoch defines the position of the orbiting body along the ellipse at a specific time the epoch the mean anomaly is a mathematically convenient angle which varies linearly with time but which does not correspond to a real geometric angle it can be converted into the true anomaly which does represent the real geometric angle in the plane of the ellipse between periapsis closest approach to the central body and the position of the orbiting object at any given time thus the true anomaly is shown as the red angle in the diagram and the mean anomaly is not shown the angles of inclination longitude of the ascending node and argument of periapsis can also be described as the euler angles defining the orientation of the orbit relative to the reference coordinate system note that non elliptic trajectories also exist but are not closed and are thus not orbits if the eccentricity is greater than one the trajectory is a hyperbola if the eccentricity is equal to one and the angular momentum is zero the trajectory is radial if the eccentricity is one and there is angular momentum the trajectory is a parabola given an inertial frame of reference and an arbitrary epoch a specified point in time exactly six parameters are necessary to unambiguously define an arbitrary and unperturbed orbit this is because the problem contains six degrees of freedom these correspond to the three spatial dimensions which define position in a cartesian coordinate system plus the velocity in each of these dimensions these can be described as orbital state vectors but this is often an inconvenient way to represent an orbit which is why keplerian elements are commonly used instead sometimes the epoch is considered a seventh orbital parameter rather than part of the reference frame if the epoch is defined to be at the moment when one of the elements is zero the number of unspecified elements is reduced to five the sixth parameter is still necessary to define the orbit it is merely numerically set to zero by convention or moved into the definition of the epoch with respect to real world clock time keplerian elements can be obtained from orbital state vectors a three dimensional vector for the position and another for the velocity by manual transformations or with computer software other orbital parameters can be computed from the keplerian elements such as the period apoapsis and periapsis when orbiting the earth the last two terms are known as the apogee and perigee it is common to specify the period instead of the semi major axis in keplerian element sets as each can be computed from the other provided the standard gravitational parameter is given for the central body instead of the mean anomaly at epoch the mean anomaly mean longitude true anomaly or rarely the eccentric anomaly might be used using for example the mean anomaly instead of mean anomaly at epoch means that time must be specified as a seventh orbital element sometimes it is assumed that mean anomaly is zero at the epoch by choosing the appropriate definition of the epoch leaving only the five other orbital elements to be specified different sets of elements are used for various astronomical bodies the eccentricity and either the semi major axis or the distance of periapsis are used to specify the shape and size of an orbit the angle of the ascending node the inclination and the argument of periapsis or the longitude of periapsis specify the orientation of the orbit in its plane either the longitude at epoch the mean anomaly at epoch or the time of perihelion passage are used to specify a known point in the orbit the choices made depend whether the vernal equinox or the node are used as the primary reference the semi major axis is known if the mean motion and the gravitational mass are known it is also quite common to see either the mean anomaly or the mean longitude expressed directly without either or as intermediary steps as a polynomial function with respect to time this method of expression will consolidate the mean motion into the polynomial as one of the coefficients the appearance will be that or are expressed in a more complicated manner but we will appear to need one fewer orbital element mean motion can also be obscured behind citations of the orbital period sets of orbital elements object elements used major planet comet asteroid two line elements the angles are the euler angles with the notations of that article characterizing the orientation of the coordinate system from the inertial coordinate frame where is in the equatorial plane of the central body is in the direction of the vernal equinox is perpendicular to and with defines the reference plane is perpendicular to the reference plane orbital elements of bodies planets comets asteroids in the solar system usually use the ecliptic as that plane are in the orbital plane and with in the direction to the pericenter periapsis is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit is mutually perpendicular to and then the transformation from the coordinate frame to the frame with the euler angles is where the inverse transformation which computes the 3 coordinates in the i j k system given the 3 or 2 coordinates in the x y z system is represented by the inverse matrix according to the rules of matrix algebra the inverse matrix of the product of the 3 rotation matrices is obtained by inverting the order of the three matrices and switching the signs of the three euler angles the transformation from to euler angles is where signifies the polar argument that can be computed with the standard function atan2 y x available in many programming languages under ideal conditions of a perfectly spherical central body and zero perturbations all orbital elements except the mean anomaly are constants the mean anomaly changes linearly with time scaled by the mean motion hence if at any instant the orbital parameters are then the elements at time is given by main article perturbation astronomy unperturbed two body newtonian orbits are always conic sections so the keplerian elements define an ellipse parabola or hyperbola real orbits have perturbations so a given set of keplerian elements accurately describes an orbit only at the epoch evolution of the orbital elements takes place due to the gravitational pull of bodies other than the primary the nonsphericity of the primary atmospheric drag relativistic effects radiation pressure electromagnetic forces and so on keplerian elements can often be used to produce useful predictions at times near the epoch alternatively real trajectories can be modeled as a sequence of keplerian orbits that osculate kiss or touch the real trajectory they can also be described by the so called planetary equations differential equations which come in different forms developed by lagrange gauss delaunay poincar or hill main article two line elements keplerian elements parameters can be encoded as text in a number of formats the most common of them is the nasa norad two line elements tle format originally designed for use with 80 column punched cards but still in use because it is the most common format and can be handled easily by all modern data storages as well depending on the application and object orbit the data derived from tles older than 30 days can become unreliable orbital positions can be calculated from tles through the sgp sgp4 sdp4 sgp8 sdp8 algorithms example of a two line element 1 27651u 03004a 07083.49636287 .00000119 00000-0 30706-4 0 2692 2 27651
