conquest of algeria the french colonial empire in 1920 the conquest of algeria was initiated in the last days of the bourbon restoration by charles x as an attempt to increase his popularity amongst the french people particularly in paris where many veterans of the napoleonic wars lived his intention was to bolster patriotic sentiment and distract attention from ineptly handled domestic policies by skirmishing against the dey in the 1790s france had contracted to purchase wheat for the french army from two merchants in algiers messrs bacri and boushnak and was in arrears paying them these merchants bacri and boushnak who had debts to the dey claimed inability to pay those debts until france paid its debts to them the dey had unsuccessfully negotiated with the french consul to rectify this situation and he suspected of collaborating with the merchants against him especially when the french government made no provisions for repaying the merchants in 1820 s nephew the consul in further angered the dey by fortifying french storehouses in and la calle against the terms of prior agreements after a contentious meeting in which refused to provide satisfactory answers on 29 april 1827 the dey struck with his fly whisk charles x used this slight against his diplomatic representative to first demand an apology from the dey and then to initiate a blockade against the port of algiers france demanded that the dey send an ambassador to france to resolve the incident when the dey responded with cannon fire directed toward one of the blockading ships the french determined that more forceful action was required main article invasion of algiers in 1830 the attack of admiral during the take over of algiers in 1830 fighting at the gates of algiers in 1830 ornate ottoman cannon

of war proposed a military expedition however the count of vill le an ultra royalist president of the council and the monarch s heir opposed any military action the restoration finally decided to blockade algiers for three years but the overpowering presence of the french naval force prevented an incursion beyond the coastal perimeter meanwhile the berber pirates were able to exploit the geography of the coast with ease before the failure of the blockade the restoration decided on 31 january 1830 to engage a military expedition against algiers admiral commandeered an armada of 600 ships that originated from toulon leading it to algiers using napoleon s 1808 contingency plan for the invasion of algeria general de bourmont then landed 27 kilometres 17 mi west of algiers at sidi ferruch on 14 june 1830 with 34,000 soldiers in response to the french the algerian dey ordered an opposition consisting of 7,000 janissaries 19,000 troops from the beys of constantine and oran and about 17,000 kabyles the french established a strong beachhead and pushed toward algiers thanks in part to superior artillery and better organization the french troops took the advantage on 19 june during the battle of and entered algiers on 5 july after a three week campaign the dey agreed to surrender in exchange for his freedom and the offer to retain possession of his personal wealth five days later he exiled himself with his family departing on a french ship for the italian peninsula then under the control of the austrian empire 2,500 janissaries also quit the algerian territories

believers could not remain indifferent to the massacres committed by the french christian troops and to belligerent calls to enter jihad from the marabouts despite the diplomatic rupture between morocco and the two sicilies in 1830 and the naval warfare engaged against the austrian empire as well as with spain then headed by ferdinand vii sultan abderrahmane lent his support to the algerian insurgency triggered by abd el kader the latter would fight for years against the french directing an army of 12,000 men abd el kader first organized the blockade of oran algerian refugees were welcomed by the moroccan population while the sultan recommended that the authorities of tetuan assist them by providing jobs in the administration or the military forces the inhabitants of tlemcen close to the moroccan border asked that they be placed under the sultan s authority in order to escape the invaders abderrahmane thus named his nephew prince moulay ali as caliph of tlemcen charged with the protection of the city in retaliation france executed two moroccans mohamed beliano and benkirane as spies while their goods were seized by the military governor of oran general boyer hardly had the news of the capture of algiers reached paris than charles x was deposed during the three glorious days of july 1830 and his cousin louis philippe the citizen king was named to preside over a constitutional monarchy the new government composed of liberal opponents of the algiers expedition was reluctant to pursue the conquest begun by the old regime but withdrawing from algeria proved more difficult than conquering it some governments and scholars have called france s conquest of algeria a genocide for example ben kiernan an australian expert on the cambodian genocide wrote in blood and soil a world history of genocide and extermination from sparta to darfur on the french conquest of algeria by 1875 the french conquest was complete the war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous algerians since 1830 a long shadow of genocidal hatred persisted provoking a french author to protest in 1882 that in algeria we hear it repeated every day that we must expel the native and if necessary destroy him as a french statistical journal urged five years late the system of extermination must give way to a policy of penetration ben kiernan blood and soil in response to france s

philippe named the as head of military staff in algeria de rogivo took control of and initiated colonisation of the land he was recalled in 1833 due to the overtly violent nature of the repression wishing to avoid a conflict with morocco louis philippe sent an extraordinary mission to the sultan mixed with displays of military might sending war ships to the bay of tangiers an ambassador was sent to the sultan moulay abderrahmane in february 1832 headed by the count of mornay and including the painter the sultan however refused french demands to evacuate tlemcen in 1834 france annexed the occupied areas of algeria which had an estimated muslim population of about two million as a colony colonial administration in the occupied areas the so called government of the sword was placed under a governor general a high ranking army officer invested with civil and military jurisdiction who was responsible to the minister of war marshal bugeaud who became the first governor general headed the conquest soon after the conquest of algiers the soldier politician bertrand clauzel and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and despite official discouragement to subsidize its settlement by european farmers triggering a land rush clauzel recognized the farming potential of the mitidja plain and envisioned the production there of cotton on a large scale as governor general 1835 36 he used his office to make private investments in land and encouraged army officers and bureaucrats in his administration to do the same this development created a vested interest among government officials in greater french involvement in algeria commercial interests with influence in the government also began to recognize the prospects for profitable land speculation in expanding the french zone of occupation they created large agricultural tracts built factories and businesses and hired local labor among others testimonies lieutenant colonel lucien de montagnac wrote on 15

children load them onto naval vessels send them to the marquesas islands or elsewhere in one word annihilate all who will not crawl beneath our feet like dogs cannon seized in constantine by french troops in 1837 whatever initial misgivings louis philippe s government may have had about occupying algeria the geopolitical realities of the situation created by the 1830 intervention argued strongly for reinforcing the french presence there france had reason for concern that britain which was pledged to maintain the territorial integrity of the ottoman empire would move to fill the vacuum left by a french pullout the french devised elaborate plans for settling the hinterland left by ottoman provincial authorities in 1830 but their efforts at state building were unsuccessful on account of lengthy armed resistance capture of constantine by french troops 13 october 1837 horace vernet the most successful local opposition immediately after the fall of algiers was led by ahmad ibn muhammad of constantine he initiated a radical overhaul of the ottoman administration in his by replacing turkish officials with local leaders making arabic the official language and attempting to reform finances according to the precepts of islam after the french failed in several attempts to gain some of the s territories through negotiation an ill fated invasion force led by had to retreat from constantine in 1836 in humiliation and defeat however the french captured constantine under the following year on 13 october 1837 historians generally set the indigenous population of algeria at one and a half million in 1830 although the algerian population decreased at some point under french rule most certainly between 1866 and 1872 the french military were not responsible for all of this decrease as a fraction of these deaths could be explained by the locust plagues of 1866 and 1868 as well as by a rigorous winter in 1867 68 which caused a famine followed by an epidemic of cholera main article lalla fatma n soumer a print showing fadhma n soumer during combat the french began their occupation of algiers in 1830 starting with a landing in algiers as occupation turned into colonization remained the only region independent of the french government pressure on the region increased and the will of her people to resist and defend increased as well a turning point in lalla fadma s life was the arrival in in about 1849 of a mysterious man who presented himself as mohamed ben abdallah the name of the prophet but who is more commonly known as bou baghla he was probably an ex lieutenant in the army of emir abdelkader defeated for the last time by the french in 1847 bou baghla refused to surrender at that battle and retreated to kabylie from there he began a war against the french armies and their allies often employing guerrilla tactics bou baghla was a relentless fighter and very eloquent in arabic he was very religious and some legends tell about his thaumaturgic skills bou baghla went often to summer to talk with the high ranking members of the religious community and lalla fadhma was soon attracted by his strong personality at the same time the relentless combatant was attracted by a woman so resolutely willing to contribute by any means possible to the war against the french with her inspiring speeches she convinced many men to fight as volunteers ready to die as martyrs and she herself together with other women participated in combat by providing cooking medicines and comfort to the fighting forces traditional sources tell that a strong bond was formed between lalla fadhma and bou baghla she saw this as a wedding of peers rather than the traditional submission as a slave to a husband in fact at that time bou baghla left his first wife fatima bent sidi aissa and sent back to her owner a slave he had as a concubine halima bent messaoud but on her side lalla fadhma wasn t free even if she was recognized as woman who left her husband to get back to his family a kabylie institution the matrimonial tie with her husband was still in place and only her husband s will could free her however he did not agree to even when offered large bribes the love between fadhma and bou remained platonic but there were public expressions of this feeling between the two fadhma was personally present at many fights in which bou baghla was involved particularly the battle of tachekkirt won by bou baghla forces 18 19 july 1854 where the french general was caught but managed to escape later on 26 december 1854 bou baghla was killed some sources claim it was due to the treason of some of his allies the resistance remained without a charismatic leader and a commander able to guide it efficiently for this reason during the first months of 1855 on a sanctuary built on top of the azru nethor peak not far from the village where fadhma was born there was a great council among combatants and important figures of the tribes in kabylie they decided to grant lalla fadhma assisted by her brothers the command of combat abd el kader the french faced other opposition as well in the area the superior of a religious brotherhood muhyi ad din who had spent time in ottoman jails for opposing the bey s rule launched attacks against the french and their makhzen allies at oran in 1832 in the same year jihad was declared and to lead it tribal elders chose muhyi ad din s son twenty five year old abd al qadir abd al qadir who was recognized as amir al muminin commander of the faithful quickly gained the support of tribes throughout algeria a devout and austere marabout he was also a cunning political leader and a resourceful warrior from his capital in tlemcen abd al qadir set about building a territorial muslim state based on the communities of the interior but drawing its strength from the tribes and religious brotherhoods by 1839 he controlled more than two thirds of algeria his government maintained an army and a bureaucracy collected taxes supported education undertook public works and established agricultural and manufacturing cooperatives to stimulate economic activity the french in algiers viewed with concern the success of a muslim government and the rapid growth of a viable territorial state that barred the extension of european settlement abd al qadir fought running battles across algeria with french forces which included units of the foreign legion organized in 1831 for algerian service although his forces were defeated by the french under general thomas bugeaud in 1836 abd al qadir negotiated a favorable peace treaty the next year the treaty of tafna gained conditional recognition for abd al qadir s regime by defining the territory under its control and salvaged his prestige among the tribes just as the shaykhs were about to desert him to provoke new hostilities the french deliberately broke the treaty in 1839 by occupying constantine abd al qadir took up the holy war again destroyed the french settlements on the mitidja plain and at one point advanced to the outskirts of algiers itself he struck where the french were weakest and retreated when they advanced against him in greater strength the government moved from camp to camp with the amir and his army gradually however superior french resources and manpower and the defection of tribal chieftains took their toll reinforcements poured into algeria after 1840 until bugeaud had at his disposal 108,000 men one third of the french army battle of smala 16 may 1843 by horace vernet one by one the amir s strongholds fell to the french and many of his ablest commanders were killed or captured so that by 1843 the muslim state had collapsed french troops disembarking on the island of mogador in essaouira bay in 1844 abd al qadir took refuge in 1841 with his ally the sultan of morocco abd ar rahman ii and launched raids into algeria this alliance led the french navy to bombard and briefly occupy mogador under the on august 16 1844 a french force was destroyed at the battle of sidi brahim in 1845 however abd al qadir was obliged to surrender to the commander of oran province general louis de lamorici re at the end of 1847 abd al qadir was promised safe conduct to egypt or palestine if his followers laid down their arms and kept the peace he accepted these conditions but the minister of war who years earlier as general in algeria had been badly defeated by abd al qadir had him consigned in france in the algeria s population under the french after 1962 year pop p a 1830 1,500,000 1851

french law without major modifications could fit the needs of an area inhabited by close to two million europeans and four million muslims muslims had no representation in the french national assembly before 1945 and were grossly under represented on local councils because of the many restrictions imposed by the authorities by 1915 only 50,000 muslims were eligible to vote in elections in the civil communes attempts to implement even the most modest reforms were blocked or delayed by the local administration in algeria dominated by and by the 27 representatives in the national assembly six deputies and three senators from each department once elected to the national assembly became permanent fixtures because of their seniority they exercised disproportionate influence and their support was important to any government s survival the leader of the delegation 1810 1875 succeeded during the 1870s in modifying or introducing legislation to facilitate the private transfer of land to settlers and continue the algerian state s appropriation of land from the local population and distribution to settlers consistent proponents of reform like and socialist were rare in the national assembly the bulk of algeria s wealth in manufacturing mining agriculture and trade was controlled by the the modern european owned and managed sector of the economy centered around small industry and a highly developed export trade designed to provide food and raw materials to france in return for capital and consumer goods europeans held about 30 of the total arable land including the bulk of the most fertile land and most of the areas under irrigation by 1900 europeans produced more than two thirds of the value of output in agriculture and practically all agricultural exports the modern or european sector was run on a commercial basis and meshed with the french market system that it supplied with wine citrus olives and vegetables nearly half of the value of european owned real property was in vineyards by 1914 by contrast subsistence cereal production supplemented by olive fig and date growing and stock raising formed the basis of the traditional sector but the land available for cropping was submarginal even for cereals under prevailing traditional cultivation practices the colonial regime imposed more and higher taxes on muslims than on europeans the muslims in addition to paying traditional taxes dating from before the french conquest also paid new taxes from which the were normally exempted in 1909 for instance muslims who made up almost 90 of the population but produced 20 of algeria s income paid 70 of direct taxes and 45 of the total taxes collected and controlled how these revenues would be spent as a result towns had handsome municipal buildings paved streets lined with trees fountains and statues while algerian villages and rural areas benefited little if at all from tax revenues the colonial regime proved severely detrimental to overall education for algerian muslims who had previously relied on religious schools to learn reading writing and engage in religious studies not only did the state appropriate the habus lands the religious foundations that constituted the main source of income for religious institutions including schools in 1843 but officials refused to allocate enough money to maintain schools and mosques properly and to provide for enough teachers and religious leaders for the growing population in 1892 more than five times as much was spent for the education of europeans as for muslims who had five times as many children of school age because few muslim teachers were trained muslim schools were largely staffed by french teachers even a state operated madrasah school often had french faculty members attempts to institute bilingual bicultural schools intended to bring muslim and european children together in the classroom were a conspicuous failure rejected by both communities and phased out after 1870 according to one estimate fewer than 5 of algerian children attended any kind of school in 1870 as late as 1954 only one muslim boy in five and one girl in sixteen was receiving formal schooling efforts were begun by 1890 to educate a small number of muslims along with european students in the french school system as part of france s civilizing mission in algeria the curriculum was entirely french and allowed no place for arabic studies which were deliberately downgraded even in muslim schools within a generation a class of well educated gallicized muslims the literally the evolved ones had been created almost all of the handful of muslims who accepted french citizenship were ironically this privileged group of muslims strongly influenced by french culture and political attitudes developed a new algerian self consciousness reporting to the french senate in 1894 governor general wrote that algeria had only a dust of people left her he referred to the destruction of the traditional ruling class that had left muslims without leaders and had deprived france of literally valid go betweens through whom to reach the masses of the people he lamented that no genuine communication was possible between the two communities the who ran algeria maintained a dialog only with the later they thwarted contact between the and official circles in france on the other they feared and mistrusted the francophone who were classified either as assimilationist insisting on being accepted as frenchmen but on their own terms or as integrationists eager to work as members of a distinct muslim elite on equal terms with the french see also indig nat following its conquest of ottoman controlled algeria in 1830 for well over a century france maintained what was effectively colonial rule in the territory though the french constitution of 1848 made algeria part of france and algeria was usually understood as such by french people even on the left algeria became the prototype for a pattern of french colonial rule which has been described as quasi apartheid when french rule began france had no well established systems for intensive colonial governance the main existing legal provision being the 1685 code noir which focused on slave trading and owning from 1830 algerians were not french citizens nor did they have a mechanism to become citizens as french rule in algeria expanded particularly under thomas robert bugeaud 1841 48 discriminatory governance became increasingly formalised in 1844 bugeaud formalised a system of european settlements along the coast under civil government with arab berber areas in the interior under military governance an important feature of french rule was cantonnement whereby tribal land that was supposedly unused was seized by the state which enabled french colonists to expand their landholdings pushing indigenous people onto more marginal land and making them more vulnerable to drought this was extended under the governance of bugeaud s successor jacques louis randon in the 1860s napoleon iii influenced by ismael urbain introduced what were intended as liberalising reforms in algeria promoting the french colonial model of assimilation whereby colonised peoples would eventually become french his reforms were resisted by colonists in algeria and his attempts to allow muslims to be elected to a putative new assembly in paris failed however he oversaw an 1865 decree that stipulated that all the colonised indigenous were under french jurisdiction i e french nationals subjected to french laws and allowed arab jewish and berber algerians to request french citizenship but only if they renounced their muslim religion and culture azzedine haddour argues that this established the formal structures of a political apartheid since few people were willing to abandon their religious values which was seen as apostasy rather than promoting assimilation the legislation had the opposite effect by 1913 only 1,557 muslims had been granted french citizenship in 1870 the french government granted algerian jews french citizenship under the cr mieux decree but not muslims this meant that most algerians were now french subjects treated as the objects of french law but were not citizens could not vote and were effectively without the right to citizenship jewish people s citizenship was revoked by the vichy government in the early 1940s but was restored in 1943 in 1881 the code de l indig nat was formally introduced enabling district officials to issue summary punishments to muslims without due legal process and to extract special taxes and forced labour in 1909 70 of all direct taxes in algeria were paid by muslims despite their general poverty opportunities for muslims improved slightly from the 1890s particularly for urban elites which helped ensure acquiescence to the introduction of military conscription for muslims in 1911 despite periodic attempts at partial reform the situation of the code de l indig nat persisted until the french fourth republic which began in 1946 but although muslim algerians were accorded the rights of citizenship the system of discrimination was maintained in more informal ways frederick cooper writes that muslim algerians were still marginalized in their own territory notably the separate voter roles of french civil status and of muslim civil status to keep their hands on power this internal system of apartheid met with considerable resistance from the muslims affected by it and is cited as one of the causes of the 1954 insurrection this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it april 2016 in november 1830 french colonial officials attempted to limit the arrivals at algerian ports by requiring the presentation of passports and residence permits the regulations created by the french government in may 1831 required permission from the interior ministry to enter algeria and other french controlled territories this may circular allowed merchants with trading interests easy access to passports because they were not permanent settlers and wealthy persons who planned on founding agricultural enterprises in algeria were also freely given access to move the circular forbid the passage of indigents and needy unskilled workers during the 1840s the french government assisted certain emigrants to algeria who were mostly urban workers from the paris basin and france s eastern frontier and were not the agricultural workers that the colonial officials wanted to be sent from france single men received 68 percent of the free passages and only 14 percent of the emigrants were women because of varying policies about the emigration of families that all favored unaccompanied males who were seen as more flexible and useful for laborious tasks initially in november 1840 families were eligible only if they had no small children and two thirds of the family was able to work then in september 1841 only unaccompanied males could travel to algeria for free and a complicated system for families was developed that made subsidized travel almost unavailable these emigrants were offered many different forms of government assistance including free passages both to the ports of france and by ship to algeria wine rations and food land concessions and promised high wages between 1841 and 1845 about 20,000 individuals were offered this assisted emigration by the french government though it is unknown exactly how many actually went to algeria these measures were funded and supported by the french government both local officials and national because they saw the move to algeria as a solution to overpopulation and unemployment those who applied for assisted emigration emphasized their work ethics undeserved employment in france a presumption of government obligation to the less fortunate by 1848 algeria was populated by 109,400 europeans only 42,274 of which were french arrival of marshal randon in algiers in 1857 a royal ordinance in 1845 called for three types of administration in algeria in areas where europeans were a substantial part of the population elected mayors and councils for self governing full exercise communes in the mixed communes where muslims were a large majority government was in the hands of appointed and some elected officials including representatives of the great chieftains and a french administrator the indigenous communes remote areas not adequately pacified remained under the rule of the sword by 1848 nearly all of northern algeria was under french control important tools of the colonial administration from this time until their elimination in the 1870s were the arab offices staffed by arabists whose function was to collect information on the indigenous people and to carry out administrative functions nominally in cooperation with the army the on occasion acted with sympathy to the local population and formed a buffer between muslims and under the the had been permitted limited self government in areas where european settlement was most intense but there was constant friction between them and the army the charged that the hindered the progress of colonization they agitated against military rule complaining that their legal rights were denied under the arbitrary controls imposed on the colony and insisting on a civil administration for algeria fully integrated with metropolitan france the army warned that the introduction of civilian government would invite muslim retaliation and threaten the security of algeria the french government vacillated in its policy yielding small concessions to the colon demands on the one hand while maintaining the r gime du sabre to control the muslim majority on the other merchant ensign 1848-1910 capture of the zaatcha 1849 1877 map of the three french departments of alger oran and constantine shortly after louis philippe s constitutional monarchy was overthrown in the revolution of 1848 the new government of the second republic ended algeria s status as a colony and declared in the 1848 constitution the occupied lands an integral part of france three civil territories alger oran and constantine were organized as departments of france local administrative units under a civilian government this made them a part of france proper as opposed to a colony for the first time french citizens in the civil territories elected their own councils and mayors muslims had to be appointed could not hold more than one third of council seats and could not serve as mayors or assistant mayors the administration of territories outside the zones settled by colons remained under the french army local muslim administration was allowed to continue under the supervision of french army commanders charged with maintaining order in newly pacified regions and the theoretically these areas were closed to european colonization the famine of algeria in 1869 even before the decision was made to annex algeria major changes had taken place in a bargain hunting frenzy to take over or buy at low prices all manner of property homes shops farms and factories europeans poured into algiers after it fell french authorities took possession of the lands from which ottoman officials had derived income over time as pressures increased to obtain more land for settlement by europeans the state seized more categories of land particularly that used by tribes religious foundations and villages called either settlers algerians or later especially following the 1962 independence of algeria literally black feet the european settlers were largely of peasant farmer or working class origin from the poor southern areas of italy spain and france others were criminal and political deportees from france transported under sentence in large numbers to algeria in the 1840s and 1850s to encourage settlement in rural areas official policy was to offer grants of land for a fee and a promise that improvements would be made a distinction soon developed between the great settlers at one end of the scale often self made men who had accumulated large estates or built successful businesses and smallholders and workers at the other end whose lot was often not much better than that of their muslim counterparts according to historian john ruedy although by 1848 only 15,000 of the 109,000 european settlers were in rural areas by systematically expropriating both pastoralists and farmers rural colonization was the most important single factor in the destructuring of traditional society european migration encouraged during the second republic stimulated the civilian administration to open new land for settlement against the advice of the army with the advent of the second empire in 1852 napoleon iii returned algeria to military control in 1858 a separate ministry of algerian affairs was created to supervise administration of the country through a military governor general assisted by a civil minister napoleon iii visited algeria twice in the early 1860s he was profoundly impressed with the nobility and virtue of the tribal chieftains who appealed to the emperor s romantic nature and was shocked by the self serving attitude of the leaders he decided to halt the expansion of european settlement beyond the coastal zone and to restrict contact between muslims and the whom he considered to have a corrupting influence on the indigenous population he envisioned a grand design for preserving most of algeria for the muslims by founding a arab kingdom with himself as the king of the arabs he instituted the so called politics of the to deal with the muslims directly through their traditional leaders to further his plans for the napoleon iii issued two decrees affecting tribal structure land tenure and the legal status of muslims in french algeria the first promulgated in 1863 was intended to renounce the state s claims to tribal lands and eventually provide private plots to individuals in the tribes thus dismantling feudal structures and protecting the lands from the tribal areas were to be identified delimited into administrative units and given over to councils arable land was to be divided among members of the over a period of one to three generations after which it could be bought and sold by the individual owners unfortunately for the tribes however the plans of napoleon iii quickly unraveled french officials sympathetic to the colons took much of the tribal land they surveyed into the public domain in addition some tribal leaders immediately sold communal lands for quick gains the process of converting arable land to individual ownership was accelerated to only a few years when laws were enacted in the 1870s stipulating that no sale of land by an individual muslim could be invalidated by the claim that it was collectively owned the cudah and other tribal officials appointed by the french on the basis of their loyalty to france rather than the allegiance owed them by the tribe lost their credibility as they were drawn into the european orbit becoming known derisively as napoleon iii visualized three distinct algerias a french colony an arab country and a military camp each with a distinct form of local government the second decree issued in 1865 was designed to recognize the differences in cultural background of the french and the muslims as french nationals muslims could serve on equal terms in the french armed forces and civil service and could migrate to france proper they were also granted the protection of french law while retaining the right to adhere to islamic law in litigation concerning their personal status but if muslims wished to become full citizens they had to accept the full jurisdiction of the french legal code including laws affecting marriage and inheritance and reject the authority of the religious courts in effect this meant that a muslim had to renounce some of the mores of his religion in order to become a french citizen this condition was bitterly resented by muslims for whom the only road to political equality was perceived to be apostasy over the next century fewer than 3,000 muslims chose to cross the barrier and become french citizens a similar status applied to the jewish natives algiers 1899 administrative organisation

the replacement of the military administration by settler committees meanwhile in france the government of the third republic directed one of its ministers to destroy the military regime and to completely assimilate algeria into france in october 1870 whose concern with algerian affairs dated from the time of the second republic issued a series of decrees providing for representation of the algerian d partements in the national assembly of france and confirming control over local administration a civilian governor general was made responsible to the ministry of interior the decrees also granted full french citizenship to algerian jews who then numbered about 40,000 this act set them apart from muslims in whose eyes they were identified thereafter with the colons the measure had to be enforced however over the objections of the colons who made little distinction between muslims and jews automatic citizenship was subsequently extended in 1889 to children of non french europeans born in algeria unless they specifically rejected it the loss of alsace lorraine to prussia in 1871 after the franco prussian war led to pressure on the french government to make new land available in algeria for about 5,000 alsatian and lorrainer refugees who were resettled there during the 1870s both the amount of european owned land and the number of settlers were doubled and tens of thousands of unskilled muslims who had been uprooted from their land wandered into the cities or to colon farming areas in search of work this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it april 2016 the most serious native insurrection since the time of abd al qadir broke out in 1871 in the and spread through much of algeria the revolt was triggered by s extension of civil that is authority to previously self governing tribal reserves and the abrogation of commitments made by the military government but it had its basis in more long standing grievances since the crimean war 1854 56 the demand for grain had pushed up the price of algerian wheat to european levels storage silos were emptied when the world market s impact was felt in algeria and muslim farmers sold their grain reserves including seed grain to speculators but the community owned silos were the fundamental adaptation of a subsistence economy to an unpredictable climate and a good year s surplus was stored away against a bad year s dearth when serious drought struck algeria and grain crops failed in 1866 and for several years following muslim areas faced starvation and with famine came pestilence it was estimated that 20 of the muslim population of constantine died over a three year period in 1871 the civil authorities repudiated guarantees made to tribal chieftains by the previous military government for loans to replenish their seed supply this act alienated even pro french muslim leaders while it undercut their ability to control their people it was against this background that the stricken kabyles rose in revolt following immediately on the mutiny in january 1871 of a squadron of muslim spahis in the french army who had been ordered to embark for france the withdrawal of a large proportion of the army stationed in algeria to serve in the franco prussian war had weakened france s control of the territory while reports of defeats undermined french prestige amongst the indigenous population in the aftermath of the 1871 uprising french authorities imposed stern measures to punish and control the whole muslim population france confiscated more than 5,000 km of tribal land and placed the kabylie under a extraordinary rule which denied the due process guaranteed french nationals a special native code listed as offenses acts such as insolence and unauthorized assembly not punishable by french law and the normal jurisdiction of the cudah was sharply restricted the governor general was empowered to jail suspects for up to five years without trial the argument was made in defense of these exceptional measures that the french penal code as applied to frenchmen was too permissive to control muslims some were deported to new caledonia see algerians of the pacific the maghreb in the

fought as french soldiers during the second world war thus algerian muslims felt that it was even more unjust that their votes were not equal to those of the other algerians especially after 1947 when the algerian assembly was created this assembly was composed of 120 members algerian muslims representing about 6.85 million people could designate 50 of the assembly members while 1,150,000 non muslim algerians could designate the other half moreover a massacre occurred in may 8 1945 it opposed algerians who were demonstrating for their national claim to the french army after skirmishes with police algerians killed about 100 french the french army retaliated harshly resulting in the deaths of approximately 6,000 algerians this triggered a radicalization of algerian nationalists and could be considered the beginning of the algerian war in 1956 about 512,000 french soldiers were in algeria no resolution was imaginable in the short term an overwhelming majority of french politicians were opposed to the idea of independence while independence was gaining ground in muslim algerians minds france was deadlocked and the fourth republic collapsed over this dispute lit long live french

throughout the years although sometimes difficult in 1962 the evian accords peace treaty provided land in the sahara for the french army which it had used under de gaulle to carry out its first nuclear tests many european settlers living in algeria and algerian sephardic jews who contrary to algerian muslims had been granted french citizenship by the cr mieux decrees at the end of the 19th century were expelled to france where they formed a new community on the other hand the issue of the the muslims who had fought on the french side during the war still remained unresolved large

present algerian government continues to refuse to allow and their descendants to return to algeria on february 23 2005 the french law on colonialism was an act passed by the union for a popular movement ump conservative majority which imposed on high school lyc e teachers to teach the positive values of colonialism to their students in particular in north africa article 4 the law created a public uproar and opposition from the whole of the left wing and was finally repealed by president jacques chirac ump at the beginning of 2006 after accusations of historical revisionism from various teachers and historians algerians feared that the french law on colonialism would hinder the task the french confronting the dark side of their colonial rule in algeria because article four of the law decreed among other things that school programmes are to recognise in particular the positive role of the french presence overseas especially in north africa benjamin stora a leading specialist on french algerian history of colonialism and a pied noir himself said france has never taken on its colonial history it is a big difference with the anglo saxon countries where post colonial studies are now in all the universities we are phenomenally behind the times in his opinion although the historical facts were known to academics they were not well known by the french public and this led to a lack of honesty in france over french colonial treatment of the algerian people was a slogan used about 1960 by those french people who wanted to keep algeria ruled by france literally french algeria it means that the three of algeria were to be considered integral parts of france by integral parts it is meant that they have their deputies representatives in the french national assembly and so on further the people of algeria who were to be permitted to vote for the deputies would be those who universally accepted french law rather than sharia which was used in personal cases among algerian muslims under laws dating back to napoleon iii and such people were predominantly of french origin or jewish origin many who used this slogan were returnees in paris during the perennial traffic jams adherence to the slogan was indicated by sounding one s automobile horn in the form of four telegraphic dots followed by a dash as whole choruses of such horn soundings were heard this was intended to be reminiscent of the second world war slogan v for victory which had been three dots followed by a dash the intention was that the opponents of were to be considered as traitorous as the
