belonging to 18th century aphoristic poet alexander pope among these is the neo gothic prototype home of horace walpole which has given its name to a whole district strawberry hill and is linked with the oldest roman catholic university in the country st mary s university twickenham contents excavations have revealed settlements in the area dating from the early neolithic possibly mesolithic periods occupation seems to have continued through the bronze age the iron age and the roman occupation the area was first mentioned as tuican hom and tuiccanham in an 8th century charter to cede the area to waldhere bishop of london for the salvation of our souls the charter dated 13 june 704 is signed with 12 crosses the signatories included swaefred of essex cenred of mercia and earl paeogthath

pope s villa all hallows twickenham as seen from the a316 bubonic plague spread to the town in 1665 and 67 deaths were recorded it appears that twickenham had a pest house in the 17th century although the location is not known there was also a watch house in the middle of the town with stocks a pillory and a whipping post whose owner was charged to ward within and about this parish and to keep all beggars and vagabonds that shall lye abide or lurk about the towne and to give correction to such in 1633 construction began on york house it was occupied by edward montagu 2nd earl of manchester in 1656 and later by edward hyde 1st earl of clarendon 1659 saw the first mention of the twickenham ferry although ferrymen had already been operating in the area for many generations sometime before 1743 a pirate ferry appears to have been started by twickenham inhabitants there is speculation that it operated to serve the folly a floating hostelry of some kind several residents wrote to the lord mayor of the city of london complaining that there is lately fixed near the shore of twickenham on the river thames a vessell made like a barge and called the folly wherein divers e loose and disorderly persons are frequently entertained who have behaved in a very indecent manner and do frequently afront divers e persons of fashion and distinction who often in an evening walk near that place and desired so great a nuisance might be removed in 1713 the nave of the ancient st mary s church collapsed and the church was rebuilt in the neo classical style to designs by a local architect john james in 1736 the noted pharmacist and quack doctor joshua ward set up the great vitriol works to produce sulphuric acid using a process discovered in the seventeenth century by johann glauber in which sulphur is burned together with saltpetre potassium nitrate in the presence of steam the process generates an extremely unpleasant smell which caused objections from local residents the area was also soon home to the world s first industrial production facility for gunpowder on a site between twickenham and whitton on the banks of the river crane there were frequent explosions and loss of life on 11 march 1758 one of two explosions was felt in reading berkshire and in april 1774 another explosion terrified people at church in isleworth in 1772 three mills blew up shattering glass and buildings in the neighbourhood horace walpole 4th earl of orford wrote complaining to his friend and relative henry seymour conway then lieutenant general of the ordnance that all the decorative painted glass had been blown out of his windows at strawberry hill the powder mills remained in operation until 1927 when they were closed much of the site is now occupied by crane park in which the old shot tower mill sluices and blast embankments can still be seen much of the area along the river next to the shot tower is now a nature reserve the 1818 enclosure award led to the development of 182 acres 0.74 km2 of land to the west of the town centre largely between the present day staines and hampton roads where new roads workhouse road middle road 3rd 2nd and 1st common roads now first to fifth cross roads respectively were laid out during the 18th and 19th centuries a number of fine houses were built and twickenham became a popular place of residence for people of fashion and distinction further development was stimulated by the opening of twickenham station in 1848 electricity was introduced to twickenham in 1902 and the first trams arrived the following year in 1939 when all hallows lombard street was demolished in the city of london its distinctive stone tower designed by christopher wren with its peal of ten bells and connecting stone cloister and the interior furnishings including a renatus harris organ and a pulpit used by john wesley were brought to twickenham to be incorporated in the new all hallows church on chertsey road a316 near twickenham stadium the twickenham green area witnessed a high profile murder on 19 august 2004 when french woman amelie delagrange aged 22 died in hospital after being found with a serious head injury caused by battery

guilty of both murders on 25 february 2008 as well as a further charge of attempted murder against 18 year old kate sheedy and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2011 he was found guilty of the murder of milly dowler a teenage girl who vanished from walton on thames in march 2002 and whose body was later found in hampshire woodland from 1868 the area was administered jointly between the newly formed middlesex county council and the twickenham local government district board with the passing of the local government act 1858 then in 1894 the local government act 1894 reconstituted the area as twickenham urban district in 1926 twickenham was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough eleven years later the urban district councils of teddington hampton hampton wick merged with twickenham york house rear view from sunken lawn in 1965 middlesex county council was abolished and replaced with the greater london council and the boroughs of twickenham richmond and
