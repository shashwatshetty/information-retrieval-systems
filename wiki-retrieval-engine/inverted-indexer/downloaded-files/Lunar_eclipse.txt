september 28 2015 april 15 2014 october 8 2014 a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly behind earth and into its shadow this can occur only when the sun earth and the moon are aligned in syzygy exactly or very closely so with the planet in between hence a lunar eclipse can occur only on the night of a full moon the type and length of an eclipse depend on the moon s proximity to either node of its orbit during a total lunar eclipse earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the moon the only light reflected from the lunar surface has been refracted by earth s atmosphere this light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does the rayleigh scattering of bluer light due to this reddish color a totally eclipsed moon is sometimes called a blood moon unlike a solar eclipse which can be viewed only from a certain relatively small area of the world a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of earth a total lunar eclipse lasts a few hours whereas a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes as viewed from any given place due to the smaller size of the moon s shadow also unlike solar eclipses lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions as they are dimmer than the full moon for the date of the next eclipse see the section recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses contents a schematic diagram of the shadow cast by earth within the umbra the central region the planet totally shields direct sunlight in contrast within the penumbra the outer portion the sunlight is only partially blocked neither the sun moon and earth sizes nor the distances between the bodies are to scale a total penumbral lunar eclipse dims the moon in direct proportion to the area of the sun s disk covered by earth this comparison of the moon within the southern part of earth s shadow during the penumbral lunar eclipse of january 1999 left and the moon outside the shadow right shows this slight darkening earth s shadow can be divided into two distinctive parts the umbra and penumbra earth totally occludes direct solar radiation within the umbra the central region of the shadow however since the sun s diameter appears about one quarter of earth s in the lunar sky the planet only partially blocks direct sunlight within the penumbra the outer portion of the shadow a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through earth s penumbra the penumbra causes a subtle dimming of the lunar surface a special type of penumbral eclipse is a total penumbral lunar eclipse during which the moon lies exclusively within earth s penumbra total penumbral eclipses are rare and when these occur the portion of the moon closest to the umbra may appear slightly darker than the rest of the lunar disk a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a portion of the moon enters earth s umbra while a total lunar eclipse occurs when the entire moon enters the planet s umbra the moon s average orbital speed is about 2,300 mph 1.03 km s or a little more than its diameter per hour so totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes nevertheless the total time between the first and the last contacts of the moon s limb with earth s shadow is much longer and could last up to four hours the relative distance of the moon from earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse s duration in particular when the moon is near apogee the farthest point from earth in its orbit its orbital speed is the slowest the diameter of earth s umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the moon s orbital distance thus the concurrence of a totally eclipsed moon near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality a central lunar eclipse is a total lunar eclipse during which the moon passes through the centre of earth s shadow contacting the antisolar point this type of lunar eclipse is relatively rare a view of the october 2014 lunar eclipse from minneapolis with the setting and partially eclipsed moon appearing squashed just above the horizon just after sunrise seen as sunlight shining on the tree in the right image a selenelion or selenehelion occurs when both the sun and an eclipsed moon can be observed at the same time this can occur only just before sunset or just after sunrise when both bodies will appear just above the horizon at nearly opposite points in the sky this arrangement has led to the phenomenon being also called a horizontal eclipse typically a number of high ridges undergoing sunrise or sunset can view it although the moon is in earth s umbra both the sun and an eclipsed moon can be simultaneously seen because atmospheric refraction causes each body to appear higher in the sky than their true geometric positions as viewed from earth the earth s shadow can be imagined as two concentric circles as the diagram illustrates the type of lunar eclipse is defined by the path taken by the moon as it passes through earth s shadow if the moon passes through the outer circle but does not reach the inner circle it is a penumbral eclipse if only a portion of the moon passes through the inner circle it is a partial eclipse and if entire moon passes through the inner circle at some point it is a total eclipse contact points relative to the earth s umbral and penumbral shadows here with the moon near is descending node the timing of total lunar eclipses are determined by its contacts p1 first contact beginning of the penumbral eclipse earth s penumbra touches the moon s outer limb u1 second contact beginning of the partial eclipse earth s umbra touches the moon s outer limb u2 third contact beginning of the total eclipse the moon s surface is entirely within earth s umbra greatest eclipse the peak stage of the total eclipse the moon is at its closest to the center of earth s umbra u3 fourth contact end of the total eclipse the moon s outer limb exits earth s umbra u4 fifth contact end of the partial eclipse earth s umbra leaves the moon s surface p4 sixth contact end of the penumbral eclipse earth s penumbra no longer makes contact with the moon the following scale the danjon scale was devised by andr danjon for rating the overall darkness of lunar eclipses l 0 very dark eclipse moon almost invisible especially at mid totality l 1 dark eclipse gray or brownish in coloration details distinguishable only with difficulty l 2 deep red or rust colored eclipse very dark central shadow while outer edge of umbra is relatively bright l 3 brick red eclipse umbral shadow usually has a bright or yellow rim l 4 very bright copper red or orange eclipse umbral shadow is bluish and has a very bright rim a solar eclipse occurs in the day time at new moon when the moon is between the earth and the sun while a lunar eclipse occurs at night when the earth passes between the sun and the moon the moon does not completely disappear as it passes through the umbra because of the refraction of sunlight by the earth s atmosphere into the shadow cone there is often confusion between a solar and lunar eclipse while both involve interactions between the sun earth and moon they are very different in their interactions a lunar eclipse occurs in two regions an outer penumbral shadow where the sunlight is dimmed and an inner umbral shadow where much dimmer sunlight only exists by refraction through the earth s atmosphere leaving a red color this can be seen in different exposures of a partial lunar eclipse for example here with exposures of 1 80 2 5 and 2 seconds the moon does not completely disappear as it passes through the umbra because of the refraction of sunlight by the earth s atmosphere into the shadow cone if the earth had no atmosphere the moon would be completely dark during an eclipse the reddish coloration arises because sunlight reaching the moon must pass through a long and dense layer of the earth s atmosphere where it is scattered shorter wavelengths are more likely to be scattered by the air molecules and the small particles and so by the time the light has passed through the atmosphere the longer wavelengths dominate this resulting light we perceive as red this is the same effect that causes sunsets and sunrises to turn the sky a reddish color an alternative way of considering the problem is to realize that as viewed from the moon the sun would appear to be setting or rising behind the earth from the moon a lunar eclipse would show a ring of reddish orange light surrounding a dark earth in the sky the amount of refracted light depends on the amount of dust or clouds in the atmosphere this also controls how much light is scattered in general the dustier the atmosphere the more that other wavelengths of light will be removed compared to red light leaving the resulting light a deeper red color this causes the resulting coppery red hue of the moon to vary from one eclipse to the next volcanoes are notable for expelling large quantities of dust into the atmosphere and a large eruption shortly before an eclipse can have a large effect on the resulting color christopher columbus predicting the lunar eclipse several cultures have myths related to lunar eclipses or allude to the lunar eclipse as being a good or bad omen the egyptians saw the eclipse as a sow swallowing the moon for a short time other cultures view the eclipse as the moon being swallowed by other animals such as a jaguar in mayan tradition or a three legged toad in china some societies thought it was a demon swallowing the moon and that they could chase it away by throwing stones and curses at it the greeks were ahead of their time when they said the earth was round and used the shadow from the lunar eclipse as evidence some hindus believe in the importance of bathing in the ganges river following an eclipse because it will help to achieve salvation similarly to the mayans the incans believed that lunar eclipses occurred when a jaguar would eat the moon which is why a blood moon looks red the incans also believed that once the jaguar finished eating the moon it could come down and devour all the animals on earth so they would take spears and shout at the moon to keep it away the ancient mesopotamians believed that a lunar eclipse was when the moon was being attacked by seven demons this attack was more than just one on the moon however for the mesopotamians linked what happened in the sky with what happened on the land and because the king of mesopotamia represented the land the seven demons were thought to be also attacking the king in order to prevent this attack on the king the mesopotamians made someone pretend to be the king so they would be attacked instead of the true king after the lunar eclipse was over the substitute king was made to disappear possibly by poisoning in some chinese cultures people would ring bells to prevent a dragon or other wild animals from biting the moon in the nineteenth century during a lunar eclipse the chinese navy fired its artillery because of this belief during the zhou dynasty in the book of songs the sight of a red moon engulfed in darkness was believed to foreshadow famine or disease see also blood moon prophecy certain lunar eclipses have been referred to as blood moons in popular articles but this is not a scientifically recognized term this term has been given two separate but overlapping meanings the first and simpler meaning relates to the reddish color a totally eclipsed moon takes on to observers on earth as sunlight penetrates the atmosphere of earth the gaseous layer filters and refracts the rays in such a way that the green to violet wavelengths on the visible spectrum scatter more strongly than the red thus giving the moon a reddish cast the second meaning of blood moon has been derived from this apparent coloration by two fundamentalist christian pastors mark blitz and john hagee they claimed that the 2014 15 lunar tetrad of four lunar eclipses coinciding with the feasts of passover and tabernacles matched the moon turning to blood described in the book of joel of the hebrew bible this tetrad was claimed to herald the second coming of christ and the rapture as described in the book of revelations on the date of the first of the eclipses in this sequence on april 15 2014 this multi exposure sequence shows the august 2017 lunar eclipse visible from the eso headquarters this collage shows the transitional stages of a lunar eclipse see also saros astronomy and eclipse cycle at least two lunar eclipses and as many as five occur every year although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common if the date and time of an eclipse is known the occurrences of upcoming eclipses are predictable using an eclipse cycle like the saros main article list of 21st century lunar
