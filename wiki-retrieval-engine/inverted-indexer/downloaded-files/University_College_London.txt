the world s largest academic health science centre and the golden triangle of research intensive english universities contents main article history of university college london the london university as drawn by thomas hosmer shepherd and published in 1827 1828 now the ucl main building ucl was founded on 11 february 1826 under the name london university as an alternative to the anglican universities of oxford and cambridge london university s first warden was leonard horner who was the first scientist to head a british university henry tonks 1923 mural the four founders of ucl despite the commonly held belief that the philosopher jeremy bentham was the founder of ucl his direct involvement was limited to the purchase of share no 633 at a cost of 100 paid in nine instalments between december 1826 and january 1830 in 1828 he did nominate a friend to sit on the council and in 1827 attempted to have his disciple john bowring appointed as the first professor of english or history but on both occasions his candidates were unsuccessful this suggests that while his ideas may have been influential he himself was less so however bentham is today commonly regarded as the spiritual father of ucl as his radical ideas on education and society were the inspiration to the institution s founders particularly the scotsmen james mill 1773 1836 and henry brougham 1778 1868 in 1827 the chair of political economy at london university was created with john ramsay mcculloch as the first incumbent establishing one of the first departments of economics in england in 1828 the

college and king s college london being named in the charter as the first two affiliates the slade school of fine art was founded as part of university college in 1871 following a bequest from felix slade in 1878 the university of london gained a supplemental charter making it the first british university to be allowed to award degrees to women the same year ucl admitted women to the faculties of arts and law and of science although women remained barred from the faculties of engineering and of medicine with the exception of courses on public health and hygiene while ucl claims to have been the first university in england to admit women on equal terms to men from 1878 the university of bristol also makes this claim having admitted women from its foundation as a college in 1876 armstrong college a predecessor institution of newcastle university also allowed women to enter from its foundation in 1871 although none actually enrolled until 1881 women were finally admitted to medical studies during the first world war in 1917 although after the war ended limitations were placed on their numbers william ramsay is regarded as the father of noble gases in 1898 sir william ramsay discovered the elements krypton neon and xenon whilst professor of chemistry at ucl in 1900 the university of london was reconstituted as a federal university with new statutes drawn up under the

incumbent was carey foster who served as principal as the post was originally titled from 1900 to 1904 he was succeeded by gregory foster no relation and in 1906 the title was changed to provost to

departments except the medical school term one runs from late september to mid december term two from mid january to late march and term three from late april to mid june certain departments operate reading weeks in early november and mid february whereas most universities primarily use their logo on mundane documents but their coat of arms on official documents such as degree certificates ucl exclusively uses its logo the present logo was adopted as part of a rebranding exercise in august 2005 prior to that date a different logo was used in which the letters ucl were incorporated into a stylised representation of the wilkins building portico ucl formerly made some use of a pseudo heraldic coat of arms depicting a raised bent arm dressed in armour holding a green upturned open wreath a version of this badge not on a shield appears to have been used by ucl union from shortly after its foundation in 1893 however the arms have never been the subject of an official grant of arms and depart from several of the rules and conventions of heraldry they are no longer formally used by the college although they are still occasionally seen in unofficial contexts or used in modified form by sports teams and societies the blazon of the arms might be rendered as purpure on a wreath of the colours argent and blue celeste an arm in armour embowed argent holding an upturned wreath of laurel vert beneath which two branches of laurel or crossed at the nombril and bound with a bowed cord or beneath the nombril a motto of blue celeste upon which cuncti adsint meritaeque expectent praemia palmae the motto is a quotation from virgil s aeneid and translates into english as let all come who by merit deserve the most reward ucl s traditional sporting and academic colours of purple and light blue are derived from the arms former ucl logo in use until 2005 ucl coat of arms from its foundation the college was deliberately secular the initial justification for this was that it would enable students of different christian traditions specifically roman catholics anglicans and protestants to study alongside each other without conflict ucl has retained this strict secular position and unlike most other uk universities has no specific religious prayer rooms there has however been a christian chaplaincy since 2005 and there is no restriction on religious groups among
