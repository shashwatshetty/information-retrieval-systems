from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search vaporization or vapourisation of an element or compound is a phase transition from the liquid phase to vapor there are two types of vaporization evaporation and boiling evaporation is a surface phenomenon whereas boiling is a bulk phenomenon this diagram shows the nomenclature for the different phase transitions evaporation is a phase transition from the liquid phase to vapor a state of substance below critical temperature that occurs at temperatures below the boiling temperature at a given pressure evaporation occurs on the surface evaporation only occurs when the partial pressure of vapor of a substance is less than the equilibrium vapor pressure for example due to constantly decreasing or negative pressures vapor pumped out of a solution will leave behind a cryogenic liquid boiling is also a phase transition from the liquid phase to gas phase but boiling is the formation of vapor as bubbles of vapor below the surface of the liquid boiling occurs when the equilibrium vapor pressure of the substance is greater than or equal to the environmental pressure the temperature at which boiling occurs is the boiling temperature or boiling point the boiling point varies with the pressure of the environment sublimation is a direct phase transition from the solid phase to the gas phase skipping the intermediate liquid phase because it does not involve the liquid phase it is not a form of vaporization the term vaporization has also been used in a colloquial or hyperbolic way to refer to the physical destruction of an object that is exposed to intense heat or explosive force where the object is actually blasted into small pieces rather than literally converted to gaseous form examples of this usage include the vaporization of the uninhabited marshall island of elugelab in the 1952 ivy mike thermonuclear test at the moment of a large enough meteor or comet impact bolide detonation a nuclear fission thermonuclear fusion or theoretical antimatter weapon detonation a flux of so many gamma ray x ray ultraviolet visual light and heat photons strikes matter in a such brief amount of time a great number of high energy photons many overlapping in the same physical space that all molecules lose their atomic bonds and fly apart all atoms lose their electron shells and become positively charged ions in turn emitting photons of a slightly lower energy than they had absorbed all such matter becomes a gas of nuclei and electrons which rise into the air due to the extremely high temperature or bond to each other as they cool the matter vaporized this way is immediately a plasma in a state of maximum entropy and this state steadily reduces via the factor of passing time due to natural processes in the biosphere and the effects of physics at normal temperatures and pressures a similar process occurs during ultrashort pulse laser ablation where the high flux of incoming electromagnetic radiation strips the target material s surface of electrons leaving positively charged atoms which undergo a coulomb explosion wikimedia commons has media related to vaporization v t e states of matter list state baryonic matter solid liquid gas vapor plasma low energy bose einstein condensate fermionic condensate degenerate matter quantum hall rydberg matter rydberg polaron strange matter superfluid supersolid photonic matter high energy qcd matter lattice qcd quark gluon plasma color glass condensate supercritical fluid other states colloid glass crystal liquid crystal time crystal quantum spin liquid exotic matter programmable matter dark matter antimatter magnetically ordered antiferromagnet ferrimagnet ferromagnet string net liquid superglass transitions boiling boiling point condensation critical line critical point crystallization deposition evaporation flash evaporation freezing chemical ionization ionization lambda point melting melting point recombination regelation saturated fluid sublimation supercooling triple point vaporization vitrification quantities enthalpy of fusion enthalpy of sublimation enthalpy of vaporization latent heat latent internal energy trouton s ratio volatility concepts binodal compressed fluid cooling curve equation of state leidenfrost effect macroscopic quantum phenomena mpemba effect order and disorder physics spinodal superconductivity superheated vapor superheating thermo dielectric effect retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title vaporization oldid 829286148 categories physical chemistrychemical processeshidden categories webarchive template wayback links
